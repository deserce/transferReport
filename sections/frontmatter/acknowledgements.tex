\section*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I must of course thank my supervisors Prof. Saiful Islam and Prof. Tim Mays for their ongoing support and guidance throughout this project.
Thanks also to Dr. Ben Morgan, for numerous interesting and insightful conversations.

The members of the MSI materials group (in no particular order: James Dawson, Ryan Sharpe, Oriol Garcia, Lucy Morgan, Alex Aziz, Nourdine Zibouche, and Rana Islam) have all provided invaluable assistance as I have found myself working through unfamiliar terrain. 
This work would have been immeasurably harder without their constant tutoring.

Thanks must also be extended to Miss Hannah Rogers, who provided the continuous supply of tea vital to the production of any written work longer than thirty words by the author.

Finally, the author and supervision team are grateful to CFH Docmail and EPSRC for jointly funding the PhD studentship which this report is part of.
