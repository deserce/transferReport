\caption[Li-ion battery schematic]{A schematic of a common Li-ion battery. During charging (a), electrons are driven to the anode by an external potential. \ce{Li+} ions move from the cathode to the anode to charge balance. During discharge (b), \ce{Li+} ions are driven to the cathode by a difference in chemical potential. The electrodes are electrically isolated by the separator, and are forced to instead travel via an external circuit and provide work.}
