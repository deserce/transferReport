\section{Future work}
\paragraph{Solid electrolytes: \ce{Li3OX} (X = \ce{Cl}, \ce{Br})}
The importance of solid electrolytes to the creation of an all-solid-state battery has led to their research being an active and rapidly evolving area.
Lithium-rich anti-perovskite ceramics (including \ce{Li3OCl}, \ce{Li3OBr} and their derivatives)\cite{Zhao2012} have demonstrated high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, good performance upon cycling, and wide stability windows.
A number of factors are known to impact the performance of these materials, including grain boundaries,\cite{Dawson2018} protonation,\cite{Dawson2018a} and halide composition,\cite{Dawson2018b} providing scope for a wide range of research avenues.

Work done by experimental collaborators has indicated the possibility of O/Cl exchange in \ce{Li3OCl}, but no work in the literature has yet examined this phenomenon.
Work in the Islam group by Dr. James Dawson has already demonstrated that potentials well suited to the study of this system are known, offering confidence that this project can be completed in the time-frame proposed in Figure \ref{fig:gantt}.
Further, the results of this study coupled with further findings by experimental collaborators may lead to further projects.
The familiarity with this system that this initial project will provide, should allow for follow up studies to be completed on relatively short time scales.

\paragraph{Disordered solids}
Chapter 3 demonstrated that a means of generating energetically feasible quasi-random structures is a necessity if lithium diffusion is to be studied disordered cathode materials.
Cluster expansion\cite{Chang2019} allows for the generation of such structures, and is a suitable route for future exploration of the system.
An extension of this technique, to concatenate such structures allowing for large scale disordered structures not computable in DFT to be studied using MD techniques, may be a necessity to generate the random percolation pathways characteristic of disordered rock-salts.

\paragraph{Timeline}
Figure \ref{fig:gantt} shows a Gantt chart of the proposed work timeline for the remainder of the PhD.
A nine month block in Figure \ref{fig:gantt} has been left as undecided, allowing for the findings of previous studies and upcoming literature to be reflected in the area of research focus in the latter stages of the PhD.
