abstract = {Layered LiFeSO4OH has recently attracted interest as a sustainable cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries that offers favorable synthesis and processing routes. Here, the defect chemistry, lithium-ion transport pathways, and cell voltages of layered LiFeSO 4OH are investigated by atomistic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) methods and compared with the tavorite polymorph. The results indicate that the layered phase exhibits two-dimensional (2D) lithium-ion diffusion with low activation energies of ∼0.2 eV for long-range transport within the bc-plane, which is important for good rate capability. The tavorite phase also shows 2D lithium-ion diffusion but with higher activation energies of ∼0.7 eV. Using DFT+U techniques the experimental voltage and structural parameters are accurately reproduced for the tavorite polymorph. For the layered structure, similar accuracy in both cell voltage and structure can only be obtained if a van der Waals functional is included in the DFT methodology to account for the interlayer binding. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Li-ion cell designs, component integrity, and manufacturing processes all have critical influence on the safety of Li-ion batteries. Any internal defective features that induce a short circuit, can trigger a thermal runaway: a cascade of reactions, leading to a device fire. As consumer device manufacturers push aggressively for increased battery energy, instances of field failure are increasingly reported. Notably, Samsung made a press release in 2017 following a total product recall of their Galaxy Note 7 mobile phone, confirming speculation that the events were attributable to the battery and its mode of manufacture. Recent incidences of battery swelling on the new iPhone 8 have been reported in the media, and the techniques and lessons reported herein may have future relevance. Here we look deeper into the key components of one of these cells and confirm evidence of cracking of electrode material in tightly folded areas, combined with a delamination of surface coating on the separator, which itself is an unusually thin monolayer. We report microstructural information about the electrodes, battery welding attributes, and thermal mapping of the battery whilst operational. The findings present a deeper insight into the battery's component microstructures than previously disseminated. This points to the most probable combination of events and highlights the impact of design features, whilst providing structural considerations most likely to have led to the reported incidences relating to this phone.},

abstract = {R eversible redox chemistry in solids under highly oxidizing conditions (for example versus H 2 /H + , Li/Li + or O 2) is a powerful tool in (electro)chemical systems, increasing the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution and methane functionalization (elec-tro)catalysts as well as the energy and power densities of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) 1. In LIBs in particular, employing high-voltage redox has been identified as a promising avenue to meeting the energy density demands of next-generation technologies such as plug-in electric vehicles. Recently, anionic oxygen redox has been shown to offer access to substantial high-voltage (de)intercalation capacity in a range of electrode materials 2-7 , spurring an intense research effort to understand this phenomenon. While many oxygen-redox-active materials have been developed, they almost universally exhibit a host of irreversible electrochemical behaviours such as voltage hysteresis and voltage fade 8. This is most notable in the anion-redox-active Li-rich layered oxides, Li 1+x M 1−x O 2 (M is a transition metal (TM) or non-TM such as Al, Sn or Mg), which exhibit capacities approaching 300 mAh g −1 but have yet to achieve commercial success due to such electrochemical behaviours 5,9. It has been shown both experimentally 10-12 and from first-principles thermodynamics 13 that the migration of M into empty Li sites 9-creating structural disorder in the form of M Li-V M antisite-cation-vacancy point-defect pairs-is at the root of voltage profile evolution and depression, particularly during the first cycle. Oxygen redox has separately been shown to trigger voltage hysteresis and sluggish kinetics 8,14 , with the implication being that oxygen redox and TM migration-vacancy formation are often intrinsically linked. Indeed, coupling between oxygen redox, cation migration and voltage hysteresis was recently observed 6. However, under the two primary models that have emerged to describe the nature of the lattice oxygen in these materials (either an approximately 2.5 {\AA} peroxo-like O 2 n-dimer 3,15 or an isolated O-anion 4,5,16), it is unclear as to why the oxidation of oxygen should lead to the correlated structural transformations and voltage hysteresis. It has been argued qualitatively that the oxidation of oxygen destabilizes the layered structure 2,15 ; however, a robust understanding of the materials design criteria for achieving structurally and electrochemically reversible anion redox remains elusive. In approaching this issue, we turn to layered Li 2 IrO 3 (equiva-lently, Li[Li 0.33 Ir 0.67 ]O 2 or LIO), which is reported to exhibit anion redox, yet unlike other Li-rich layered oxides exhibits highly reversible structural and electrochemical behaviour during cycling 15,17. Upon substituting redox-inactive Sn for Ir, the solid-solution material Li 2 Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 (LISO) forms M Li-V M defects during charge, accompanied by voltage hysteresis during subsequent cycling that is typical of other anion-redox-active oxides 15. This tunability makes LIO/LISO an ideal model system for studying the link between anion redox, local structure and irreversible electrochemistry. Reversible high-voltage redox chemistry is an essential component of many electrochemical technologies, from (electro)cata-lysts to lithium-ion batteries. Oxygen-anion redox has garnered intense interest for such applications, particularly lithium-ion batteries, as it offers substantial redox capacity at more than 4 V versus Li/Li + in a variety of oxide materials. However, oxidation of oxygen is almost universally correlated with irreversible local structural transformations, voltage hysteresis and voltage fade, which currently preclude its widespread use. By comprehensively studying the Li 2−x Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 model system, which exhibits tunable oxidation state and structural evolution with y upon cycling, we reveal that this structure-redox coupling arises from the local stabilization of short approximately 1.8 {\AA} metal-oxygen $\pi$ bonds and approximately 1.4 {\AA} O-O dimers during oxygen redox, which occurs in Li 2−x Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 through ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Crucially, formation of these oxidized oxygen species necessitates the decoordination of oxygen to a single covalent bonding partner through formation of vacancies at neighbouring cation sites, driving cation disorder. These insights establish a point-defect explanation for why anion redox often occurs alongside local structural disordering and voltage hysteresis during cycling. Our findings offer an explanation for the unique electrochemical properties of lithium-rich layered oxides, with implications generally for the design of materials employing oxygen redox chemistry.

The main challenge of the field today is in meeting the demands necessary to make the electric vehicle fully commercially viable. This requires high energy and power densities with no compromise in safety. Three families of advanced cathode materials (the limiting factor for energy density in the Li battery systems) are discussed in detail: LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 high voltage spinel compounds, Li2MnO3-LiMO2 high capacity composite layered compounds, and LiMPO4, where M = Fe, Mn. Graphite, Si, Li xTOy, and MO (conversion reactions) are discussed as anode materials. The electrolyte is a key component that determines the ability to use high voltage cathodes and low voltage anodes in the same system. Electrode-solution interactions and passivation phenomena on both electrodes in Li-ion batteries also play significant roles in determining stability, cycle life and safety features. This presentation is aimed at providing an overall picture of the road map necessary for the future development of advanced high energy density Li-ion batteries for EV applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Lithium-metal batteries (LMBs), as one of the most promising next-generation high-energy-density storage devices, are able to meet the rigid demands of new industries. However, the direct utilization of metallic lithium can induce harsh safety issues, inferior rate and cycle performance, or anode pulverization inside the cells. These drawbacks severely hinder the commercialization of LMBs. Here, an up-to-date review of the behavior of lithium ions upon deposition/dissolution, and the failure mechanisms of lithium-metal anodes is presented. It has been shown that the primary causes consist of the growth of lithium dendrites due to large polarization and a strong electric field at the vicinity of the anode, the hyperactivity of metallic lithium, and hostless infinite volume changes upon cycling. The recent advances in liquid organic electrolyte (LOE) systems through modulating the local current density, anion depletion, lithium flux, the anode–electrolyte interface, or the mechanical strength of the interlayers are highlighted. Concrete strategies including tailoring the anode structures, optimizing the electrolytes, building artificial anode–electrolyte interfaces, and functionalizing the protective interlayers are summarized in detail. Furthermore, the challenges remaining in LOE systems are outlined, and the future perspectives of introducing solid-state electrolytes to radically address safety issues are presented.},

abstract = {Rechargeable lithium batteries have risen to prominence as key devices for green and sustainable energy development. Electric vehicles, which are not equipped with an internal combustion engine, have been launched in the market. Manganese- and iron-based positive-electrode materials, such as LiMn(2)O(4) and LiFePO(4), are used in large-scale batteries for electric vehicles. Manganese and iron are abundant elements in the Earth's crust, but lithium is not. In contrast to lithium, sodium is an attractive charge carrier on the basis of elemental abundance. Recently, some layered materials, where sodium can be electrochemically and reversibly extracted/inserted, have been reported. However, their reversible capacity is typically limited to 100 mAh g(-1). Herein, we report a new electrode material, P2-Na(2/3)[Fe(1/2)Mn(1/2)]O(2), that delivers 190 mAh g(-1) of reversible capacity in the sodium cells with the electrochemically active Fe(3+)/Fe(4+) redox. These results will contribute to the development of rechargeable batteries from the earth-abundant elements operable at room temperature.},

abstract = {There is an urgent need for low-cost, resource-friendly, high-energy-density cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries to satisfy the rapidly increasing need for electrical energy storage. To replace the nickel and cobalt, which are limited resources and are associated with safety problems, in current lithium-ion batteries, high-capacity cathodes based on manganese would be particularly desirable owing to the low cost and high abundance of the metal, and the intrinsic stability of the Mn 4+ oxidation state. Here we present a strategy of combining high-valent cations and the partial substitution of fluorine for oxygen in a disordered-rocksalt structure to incorporate the reversible Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ double redox couple into lithium-excess cathode materials. The lithium-rich cathodes thus produced have high capacity and energy density. The use of the Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ redox reduces oxygen redox activity, thereby stabilizing the materials, and opens up new opportunities for the design of high-performance manganese-rich cathodes for advanced lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion-based energy storage is becoming a pervasive technology in today's society. Introduced in the early 1990s for use in portable electronics, it has now migrated to applications such as transportation and grid, for which energy storage needs will soon dwarf the use in electronics 1,2 . Indeed, today, with electric vehicles making up about 1{\%} of all car sales, almost half of all Li-ion batteries produced are already directed towards transportation. These new applications increase the demand for safe high-energy storage at low cost and without relying on constrained natural resources 1,2 . In this context, it is remarkable that almost all Li-ion cathode materials rely on only two transition metals, Ni and Co, which are the electroactive elements in the layered-rocksalt cathode materials in the Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O 2 chemical space (NMCs) 3 . On one end of this compositional spectrum, LiCoO 2 dominates the electronics sector, whereas Ni-rich materials are of interest for the auto-motive sector 2 . Although Mn has been used in a spinel cathode 4 , and Fe in the LiFePO 4 olivine 5 , these compounds suffer from low energy density. Given the limits of energy density that can be achieved with the layered NMCs and the potential resource constraints on cobalt 2 , it is of interest to develop high-capacity cathode materials based on other redox metals. In particular, transition metals that can exchange two electrons are of interest for their ability to create high capacity, similar to the Ni 2+ /Ni 4+ couple in NMC cathodes. Low cost and low toxicity make the Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ couple particularly desirable 6 for designing high-performance Li-ion batteries that are also inexpensive and eco-friendly. Manganese is currently used in cathode materials, but mostly in the inert Mn 4+ state, as in NMC cathodes, or for its Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ couple, as in LiMn 2 O 4 spinel 1,3,4,7 . More recently, Mn 3+ has been used in disordered-rocksalt-type cathodes, such as Li 1.3 Mn 0.4 Nb 0.3 O 2 , in which the low capacity from Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ needs to be overcome by a large amount of oxygen redox 8 , which can trigger O loss, resulting in substantial voltage and capacity fade 7,9,10 . In Li 4 Mn 2 O 5 , a high ini-tial capacity ({\textgreater}300 mAh g −1) is achieved by oxidizing Mn 3+ past the standard Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ redox couple, but this causes substantial voltage and capacity fade in subsequent cycles 11 . In our approach, we start instead from Mn 2+ in the discharged state so that a high theoretical capacity can be obtained by oxidizing to Mn 4+ without relying on O redox. Cycling between two stable valence states of Mn, and limiting the O redox, is expected to improve the reversibility of the charge/discharge process. Reduction to Mn 2+ has been observed 12 by lithiation of amor-phous Li 1.5 Na 0.5 MnO 2.85 I 0.12 , but as this cathode material is synthesized in the charged state it does not enable Li to be brought into the Li-ion cell. The development of a high-performance Li-ion cathode based on the Mn 2+},

abstract = {This critical review presents the state of the art research progress, proposes strategies to improve the conductivity of solid electrolytes, discusses the chemical and electrochemical stabilities, and uncovers future perspectives for solid state batteries.Among the contenders in the new generation energy storage arena, all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) have emerged as particularly promising, owing to their potential to exhibit high safety, high energy density and long cycle life. The relatively low conductivity of most solid electrolytes and the often sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the interface between solid electrolyte and electrode layers are considered to be amongst the major challenges facing ASSBs. This review presents an overview of the state of the art in solid lithium and sodium ion conductors, with an emphasis on inorganic materials. The correlations between the composition, structure and conductivity of these solid electrolytes are illustrated and strategies to boost ion conductivity are proposed. In particular, the high grain boundary resistance of solid oxide electrolytes is identified as a challenge. Critical issues of solid electrolytes beyond ion conductivity are also discussed with respect to their potential problems for practical applications. The chemical and electrochemical stabilities of solid electrolytes are discussed, as are chemo-mechanical effects which have been overlooked to some extent. Furthermore, strategies to improve the practical performance of ASSBs, including optimizing the interface between solid electrolytes and electrode materials to improve stability and lower charge transfer resistance are also suggested.},

The lithium nickel phosphate was prepared and characterized in order to evaluate a new potential cathode material for our ongoing research in aqueous rechargeable batteries. Annealing the final product is critical in obtaining the stoichiometric LiNiPO4pure phase; conventional cooling to a room temperature leads to an indication of Li3PO4and NiO secondary phases as impurities. The synchrotron infrared radiation (SR-IR) as a source for IR spectroscopy pins down the differences in the chemical bonding for annealed and conventional cooled LiNiPO4samples. The cyclic voltammetric and galvanostatic studies showed annealed LiNiPO4is electrochemically active from which lithium ions can be de-intercalated during oxidation process leading to an amorphous NiPO4and a minor product of nickel(II) hydroxide ($\beta$-NiOOH). During subsequent reduction, lithium ions are not fully intercalated, however, the structure is reversible and adequate for multiple cycles. The high potential in LiNiPO4looks to be very attractive in terms of high energy density, given the efficiency is improved. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Development and discovery of cathode materials with superior performance seem to be tremendous challenges for Li-ion battery scientists. Since the topotactic reaction was first demonstrated in the 1970s, layered Li transition metal oxides (LiMO2, M = Co, Ni, Mn) have been a shining star throughout the research and innovation in intercalation materials due to their appealing merits. Generally the basic LiMO2 with a single kind of transition metal ion suffers from safety concerns and structural instability and can not support high energy Li-ion batteries. Nowadays, Li-stoichiometric mixed metal oxides and Li-excess Mn-based oxides have been considered as the most promising families of cathode materials for large-scale Li-ion batteries with high energy density used for transportation. In the present paper, with the help of a phase diagram tetrahedron, we provide an overview of the major developments in the field of LiMO2 cathode materials. The changes in structure during Li extraction and the phase compatibility of Li mixed metal oxides are highlighted. The latest progress in the research of Li-excess Mn-based oxides is also included.},

Metal oxide-coated Li[Li0.05Ni0.4Co0.15Mn 0.4]O2 obviously showed higher capacity with good cyclability.

The current study illustrates the application of a well-known method of cluster expansion from alloy thermodynamics to resolve the crystal structure of a novel promising cathode compound for Li-ion batteries, Li4Mn2O5. We systematically narrow down the possible space of site orderings through the construction of a gradually improved cluster expansion based on the first principles calculation of total energy to obtain the ground state structure of Li4Mn2O5. The new-found ground state is 66 meV/f.u. lower than the previously determined ground state for this material. On the basis of the new-found Li4Mn2O5-structure, we compute the phase stability of the family of the isostructural 3d transition metal oxides and find that the oxides are metastable in both the lithiated and delithiated states. The exception to this general trend is exhibited by vanadium pentoxide, which is found to be robustly stable in both lithiated and delithiated states. The V2O5 phase in the new structure is more stable by over 1 eV/f.u. compared to the well-known ground state polymorph in Pmmn phase. The delithiation of the lithiated phase can provide a plausible synthesis route to this hitherto unknown ground state polymorph of vanadium pentoxide. The current study not only resolves the crystal structure of Li4Mn2O5, but also predicts the ground state polymorph of V2O5 through a computational route.},

Electrochemical performances demonstrates that flake cathode delivered a significantly enhanced rate capability as compared to conventional particles prepared by regular co-precipitation method. The specific capacity of flakes cycled at 0.1 and 1 C were 210 and 155 mAh/g, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry represents distinct intercalation mechanisms between two samples, in which a higher lithium diffusivity is derived by flakes with respect to particle ones. Electrochemical impedance profiles shows that the charge-transfer resistances of flake cathodes could be effectively suppressed with respect to particles after cycled at elevated discharge rates.

It is apparent that the mechanism of lithium extraction from lithium-rich Li2MnO3 is not fully understood, especially in relation to the observed O2 evolution and structural transformation. Here, delithiation and kinetic processes in Li2MnO3 are investigated using ab initio simulation techniques employing high level hybrid functionals as they reproduce accurately the electronic structure of oxygen hole states. We show that Li extraction is charge-compensated by oxidation of the oxide anion, so that the overall delithiation reaction involves lattice oxygen loss. Localized holes on oxygen (O–) are formed as the first step but are not stable leading to oxygen dimerization (with O–O ∼ 1.3 {\AA}) and eventually to the formation of molecular O2. Oxygen dimerization facilitates Mn migr...},

Here, we apply a multi-technique approach to the Li-ion conducting system (1–z)Li4SiO4–(z)Li3PO4 with the aim of developing a solid electrolyte with enhanced ionic conductivity.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. One of the most promising avenues for future high energy Li-ion batteries originate from the family of Li-rich layered cathodes. However, while exhibiting excellent initial capacity, these materials also suffer from voltage fade, high impedance, and poor rate capability, particularly in the Mn-rich, high Li excess concentration regime. Though it is clear that the Li 2 MnO 3 component contributes to the high capacity as well as the chemical and structural degradation of the material, the inherent ionic conductivity of the material has not been clarified. In this work, we investigate the delithiation mechanism, involving coherent Li migration from two layers by first-principles density functional theory. Surprisingly, and contrary to expectations from available experimental results, we find that the pristine material exhibits excellent Li mobility enabling facile Li extraction from both the transition metal layer and Li-layer. Generally, the Li-extractions are highly accelerated by di- and trivacancy clusters, which stabilize the saddle point tetrahedral sites. Hence, we deduce that the observed inferior rate behavior of this class of Li cathode materials is not due to intrinsic poor bulk ionic mobility, but more likely due to surface-passivation, structural deterioration, and/or particle-particle electrode-level transport limitations.},

abstract = {Electrical and ionic conductivity are two major limiting factors for LiCoPO4cathode material. To overcome these shortcomings, a Cr-substituted LiCoPO4core with a conductive carbon layer cathode material is synthesized using the sol-gel method. The physical chemistry properties of these materials are systematically investigated by using various characterization methods. For instance, the XRD and Rietveld refinement results reveal that Cr successfully substitutes the Co within the LiCoPO4core to form LiCo1-1.5xCrxPO4/C (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) without changing the olivine structure but exhibits a decrease in the unit cell volume with increasing Cr substitution. SEM and TEM images indicate that Cr substitution does not lead to changes in the basic morphology of LiCo1-1.5xCrxPO4/C (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) material, which is composed of agglomerated nanoparticles with an 8 nm carbon layer on the surface. The EDS and XPS results confirm that Cr is uniformly distributed on the surface and that the oxidation state of Cr is +3. FTIR spectra indicate that the antisite defect concentration decreases with increasing Cr substitution. Furthermore, Cr substitution significantly improves the electrochemical performances of LiCo1-1.5xCrxPO4/C (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) cathode. Notably, the LiCo0.94Cr0.04PO4/C delivers an initial discharge capacity of 144 mA h g−1at 0.1 C and shows a capacity retention of 71{\%} after 100 cycles between 3.0 and 5.0 V. The CV and EIS results indicate that the polarization is reduced and that the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Cr substitution. The good electrochemical performances for Cr-substituted LiCoPO4/C electrodes are attributed to the lower antisite defect concentration, as the reduction of polarization, the improvement of electronic and ion conductivity and the uniform carbon layer. These features will accelerate the commercial application of LiCoPO4towards the start-art of the high voltage lithium-ion batteries.},

The natures of the ligand and metal composing the skeleton of the host framework are analyzed and shown to have large impacts on the performance of solid-state electrolytes. A comprehensive identification of the candidate migrating species and structures is carried out. Not only the bulk properties of the conductors are explored, but the concept of tuning the conductivity through interfacial effects?specifically controlling grain boundaries and strain at the interfaces?is introduced. High-frequency dielectric constants and frequencies of low-energy optical phonons are shown as examples of properties that correlate with activation energy across many classes of ionic conductors. Experimental studies and theoretical results are discussed in parallel to give a pathway for further improvement of solid-state electrolytes. Through this discussion, the present Review aims to provide insight into the physical parameters affecting the diffusion process, to allow for more efficient and target-oriented research on improving solid-state ion conductors.},

All-solid-state Li-ion batteries are currently attracting considerable research attention as they present a viable opportunity for increased energy density and safety when compared to conventional liquid electrolyte-based devices. The Li-rich anti-perovskite Li 3−x OH x Cl has generated recent interest as a potential solid electrolyte material, but its lithium and proton transport capabilities as a function of composition are not fully characterised. In this work, we apply a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics and 1 H, 2 H and 7 Li solid-state NMR spectroscopy to study the mobility of lithium ions and protons in Li 3−x OH x Cl. Our calculations predict a strongly exothermic hydration enthalpy for Li 3 OCl, which explains the ease with which this material absorbs moisture and the difficulty in synthesising moisture-free samples. We show that the activation energy for Li-ion conduction increases with increasing proton content. The atomistic simulations indicate fast Li-ion diffusion but rule out the contribution of long-range proton diffusion. These findings are supported by variable-temperature solid-state NMR experiments, which indicate localised proton motion and long-range Li-ion mobility that are intimately connected. Our findings confirm that Li 3−x OH x Cl is a promising solid electrolyte material for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. },

Neither structural change nor oxygen loss was found in rhombohedral layered LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 upon heating to 600 °C. Li x Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 electrodes were found to retain the rhombohedral, layered structure with space group R3̄m until the temperature reached ∼300 °C (∼275 °C for Li 0.2 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 and ∼350 °C for Li 0.9 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 ). Rietveld refinement revealed that a considerable amount of octahedral cations migrated from the transition metal layer to the Li layer in the rhombohedral structure of Li 0.2 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 from 100 to 275 °C while no detectable change in the cation distribution was noted for Li 0.9 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 up to 300 °C. TGA results showed that the weight loss from Li 0.2 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 and Li 0.9 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 began at ∼260 °C and ∼400 °C, respectively, and considerably higher weight loss was found for Li 0.2 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 relative to Li 0.9 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 upon heating.

The onset temperatures of structural transitions to the spinel-type and rocksalt-type structures from Li 0.2 Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 were ∼100 °C and ∼230 °C higher than those previously reported for Li x NiO 2 (x = 0.3) measured under similar conditions in previous studies, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The performance of the batteries also depends on the porous structure of separators. Here we report improved coulombic efficiency and capacity retention of LiCoPO4by using a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous polyimide (3DOM PI) separator, compared with a conventional polypropylene separator with heterogeneous pore structure. The enhanced cycle stability of the cell using 3DOM PI separator is attributed to its ordered macroporous structure and high anodic stability. The uniform current distribution created by the ordered macroporous structure results in the low overpotential during charge process, preventing the oxidation of electrolyte and the growth of the resistive film on the cathode surface during cycling. Furthermore, the high anodic stability of 3DOM PI separator maintains its chemical and macroporous structures after cycling at high potentials, leading to the superior stability of the cell.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently-those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers-the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90 {\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics situations are also discussed.},

abstract = {Antiperovskite glasses such as Li3OCl and doped analogues have been proposed as excellent electrolytes for all-solid-state Li ion batteries (ASSB). Incorporating these electrolytes in ASSBs results in puzzling properties. This Letter describes a theoretical Li3OCl glass created by conventional melt–quench procedures. The ion conductivities are calculated using molecular dynamics based on a polarizable force field that is fitted to an extensive set of density functional theory-based energies, forces, and stresses for a wide range of nonequilibrium structures encompassing crystal, glass, and melt. We find high Li+ ion conductivity in good agreement with experiments. However, we also find that the Cl– ion is mobile as well so that the Li3OCl glass is not a single-ion conductor, with a transference number t+ ≈ 0.84. This has important implications for its use as an electrolyte for all-solid-state batteries because the Cl could react irreversibly with the electrodes and/or produce glass decomposition during discharge–charge.},

abstract = {Positive electrodes for Li-ion and lithium batteries (also termed "cathodes") have been under intense scrutiny since the advent of the Li-ion cell in 1991. This is especially true in the past decade. Early on, carbonaceous materials dominated the negative electrode and hence most of the possible improvements in the cell were anticipated at the positive terminal; on the other hand, major developments in negative electrode materials made in the last portion of the decade with the introduction of nanocomposite Sn/C/Co alloys and Si-C composites have demanded higher capacity positive electrodes to match. Much of this was driven by the consumer market for small portable electronic devices. More recently, there has been a growing interest in developing Li-sulfur and Li-air batteries that have the potential for vastly increased capacity and energy density, which is needed to power large-scale systems. These require even more complex assemblies at the positive electrode in order to achieve good properties. This review provides an overview of the major developments in the area of positive electrode materials in both Li-ion and Li batteries in the past decade, and particularly in the past few years. Highlighted are concepts in solid-state chemistry and nanostructured materials that conceptually have provided new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials.},

This study proposes a practical methodology for the identification of stable cation-disordered rocksalts. Here, it is established that the efficient method, which makes use of special quasirandom structures, correctly predicts cation-ordering strengths in agreement with accurate Monte-Carlo simulations and experimental observations. By applying the approach to the composition space of ternary oxides with formula unit LiA0.5B0.5O2 (A, B: transition metals), this study discovers a previously unknown cation-disordered structure, LiCo0.5Zr0.5O2, that may function as the basis for a new class of cation-disordered cathode materials. This computational prediction is confirmed experimentally by solid-state synthesis and subsequent characterization by powder X-ray diffraction demonstrating the potential of the computational screening of large composition spaces for accelerating materials discovery.},

abstract = {Lithium manganite, Li2MnO3, is an attractive cathode material for rechargeable lithium ion batteries due to its large capacity, low cost and low toxicity. We employed well-established atomistic simulation techniques to examine defect processes, favourable dopants on the Mn site and lithium ion diffusion pathways in Li2MnO3. The Li Frenkel, which is necessary for the formation of Li vacancies in vacancy-assisted Li ion diffusion, is calculated to be the most favourable intrinsic defect (1.21 eV/defect). The cation intermixing is calculated to be the second most favourable defect process. High lithium ionic conductivity with a low activation energy of 0.44 eV indicates that a Li ion can be extracted easily in this material. To increase the capacity, trivalent dopants (Al3+, Co3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, In3+, Y3+, Gd3+ and La3+) were considered to create extra Li in Li2MnO3. The present calculations show that Al3+ is an ideal dopant for this strategy and that this is in agreement with the experiential study of Al-doped Li2MnO3. The favourable isovalent dopants are found to be the Si4+ and the Ge4+ on the Mn site.},

abstract = {During the past two decades, the demand for the storage of electrical energy has mushroomed both for portable applications and for static applications. As storage and power demands have increased predominantly in the form of batteries, the system has evolved. However, the present electrochemical systems are too costly to penetrate major new markets, still higher performance is required, and environmentally acceptable materials are preferred. These limitations can be over- come only by major advances in new materials whose constituent elements must be available in large quantities in nature; nanomaterials appear to have a key role to play. New cathode materials with higher storage capacity are needed, as well as safer and lower cost anodes and stable elec- trolyte systems. Flywheels and pumped hydropower also have niche roles to play.},

The lithium percolation properties of the three most common lithium metal oxide phases, the layered $\alpha$-NaFeO2 structure, the spinel-like LT-LiCoO2 structure, and the $\gamma$-LiFeO2 structure, are demonstrated and a strong dependence of the percolation thresholds on the cation ordering and the lithium content is observed. The poor performance of $\gamma$-LiFeO2-type structures is explained by their lack of percolation of good Li migration channels. The spinel-like structure exhibits excellent percolation properties that are robust with respect to off-stoichiometry and some amount of cation disorder. The layered structure is unique, as it possesses two different types of lithium diffusion channels, one of which is, however, strongly dependent on the lattice parameters, and therefore very sensitive to disorder. In general it is found that a critical Li-excess concentration exists at which Li percolation occurs, although the amount of Li excess needed depends on the partial cation ordering. In fully cation-disordered materials, macroscopic lithium diffusion is enabled by ≈10{\%} excess lithium.},

Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

This procedure provides internal consistency to the potential model for studying the energetics of the defect chemistry of BaTiO(3). This is tested by examining rare-earth cation doping in BaTiO(3) and considering all five possible compensation schemes. Our simulations are in agreement with experiment and predict small rare-earth cations to dope exclusively on the Ti site; medium sized rare-earth cations to dope on both the Ti and Ba sites and large rare-earth cation doping exclusively on the Ba-site. For Ba-site substitution the simulations predict electron compensation to be energetically unfavourable compared to the formation of Ti vacancies.},

Samples have been synthesized and characterized in our laboratory, and a preliminary electrochemical characterization shows that Ni doping increases slightly the performances in Li-ion cells at low Ni concentrations x. Results of both XRD and XAS techniques are consistent and indicate ordering of Li in the M1 site, and of Fe and Ni in the M2 site of the olivine structure. Ni doping is found to induce an anisotropic shrinking of the unit cell with both Fe and Ni six-coordinated with oxygens, occupying distorted octahedral sites. The local structure measured by XAS shows that average Fe-O and Ni-O distances do not change appreciably with Ni doping indicating that the reduction of cell size is mainly associated with the presence of shorter Ni-O distances at M2 sites. Possible connections among the presence of a distribution of distorted octahedra of different size in the structure and different electrochemical performances of the material as a function of doping are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, their commercialization has been stalled by practical issues (i.e. voltage hysteresis, poor rate capability, and voltage fade) and hence it is necessary to investigate whether these problems are intrinsically inherent to anionic redox and its structural consequences. To this end, the ‘model' Li-rich layered oxide Li2Ru0.75Sn0.25O3 (LRSO) is here used as a fertile test-bed for scrutinizing the effects of cationic and anionic redox independently since they are neatly isolated at low and high potentials, respectively. Through an arsenal of electrochemical techniques, we demonstrate that voltage hysteresis is triggered by anionic redox and grows progressively with deeper oxidation of oxygen in conjunction with the deterioration of both interfacial charge-transfer kinetics and bulk diffusion coefficient. We equally show that this anionic-driven poor kinetics keeps deteriorating further with cycling and we also find that voltage fades faster if oxygen is kept oxidized for longer. Our findings, which are in fact harsher for LR-NMC, convey caution that anionic redox risks practical problems; hence, when chasing larger capacities with this class of materials, we encourage considering real-world applications.},

A total of 1 mole of Li can be extracted from Li[Li1/3Mn2/3]O-2, and the first cycle efficiency is similar to 66{\%} regardless of state of charge. Larger charge-discharge capacity is obtained from materials with smaller particle size and larger amount of stacking faults. Composition and structural analyses indicate that Li are removed from both the Li and transitional metal layers of the material during charging. Results from X-ray-absorption fine-structure measurements suggest that the valence of Mn remains at 4+ during charging but is reduced during discharging. Charging is accompanied by gas generation: at 25 degrees C, oxygen is the main gas detected, and the total amount accounts for similar to 1/8 mole of O-2 generation from Li[Li1/3Mn2/3]O-2. At an elevated temperature, amount of CO2 increases due to electrolyte decomposition. Li2MnO3 shows poor cycle performance, which is attributed to phase transformation and low charge-discharge efficiency during cycling. Low first-cycle efficiency, gas generation, and poor cycle performance limit the usage of Li2MnO3 in practical batteries.},

abstract = {Since their successful commercialization in 1990s, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely applied in portable digital products. The energy density and power density of LIBs are inadequate, however, to satisfy the continuous growth in demand. Considering the cost distribution in battery system, it is essential to explore cathode/anode materials with excellent rate capability and long cycle life. Nanometer-sized electrode materials could quickly take up and store numerous Li+ ions, afforded by short diffusion channels and large surface area. Unfortunately, low thermodynamic stability of nanoparticles results in electrochemical agglomeration and raises the risk of side reactions on electrolyte. Thus, micro/nano and hetero/hierarchical structures, characterized by ordered assembly of different sizes, phases, and/or pores, have been developed, which enable us to effectively improve the utilization, reaction kinetics, and structural stability of electrode materials. This review summarizes the recent efforts on electrode materials with hierarchical structures, and discusses the effects of hierarchical structures on electrochemical performance in detail. Multidimensional self-assembled structures can achieve integration of the advantages of materials with different sizes. Core/yolk–shell structures provide synergistic effects between the shell and the core/yolk. Porous structures with macro-, meso-, and micropores can accommodate volume expansion and facilitate electrolyte infiltration.},

abstract = {Reversible anionic redox has rejuvenated the search for high-capacity lithium-ion battery cathodes. Real-world success necessitates the holistic mastering of this electrochemistry's kinetics, thermodynamics, and stability. Here we prove oxygen redox reactivity in the archetypical lithium-and manganese-rich layered cathodes through bulk-sensitive synchrotron based spectroscopies, and elucidate their complete anionic/cationic charge-compensation mechanism. Furthermore, via various electroanalytical methods, we answer how the anionic/cationic interplay governs application-wise important issues-namely sluggish kinetics, large hysteresis, and voltage fade-that afflict these promising cathodes despite widespread industrial and academic efforts. We find that cationic redox is kinetically fast and without hysteresis unlike sluggish anions, which furthermore show different oxidation vs. reduction potentials. Additionally, more time spent with fully oxidized oxygen promotes voltage fade. These fundamental insights about anionic redox are indispensable for improving lithium-rich cathodes. Moreover, our methodology provides guidelines for assessing the merits of existing and future anionic redox-based high-energy cathodes, which are being discovered rapidly.},

abstract = {Previously reported forms of the cation-anion Buckingham potential provide a significantly greater contribution than the repulsive Coulombic component at short-range thus predicting an unphysical attraction between the pair of ions. A detailed reappraisal of the computer modelling of uranium dioxide (UO2) employing atomistic simulation techniques is presented. An improved set of interatomic potentials is derived in order to describe the lattice correctly under conditions subsequent to radiation damage with the creation of Frenkel pair defects. Novel methodology is employed in the derivation of potentials ensuring applicability over the entire region of interest. The cation-anion potential is obtained via a combination of empirical fitting to crystal structural data and parametric fitting to additional physical properties. These potentials are subsequently verified and validated by calculation of additional bulk lattice properties, whose values agree favourably with those measured experimentally. Atomistic computer simulation techniques are then used to investigate the defect properties of UO2. The theoretical techniques are based upon efficient energy minimization procedures and Mott-Littleton methodology for accurate defect modelling and employed to calculate intrinsic defect formation energies and enable predictions of the expected type of intrinsic disorder to be made. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The structural properties of layered Li[Li1/9Ni1/3Mn5/9]O2 positive electrodes nominally coated with aluminum fluoride are studied. Coatings were prepared by using aqueous solutions with various concentrations of aluminum and fluorine and are compared with samples treated under similar conditions but with aqueous HCl solutions. Samples were investigated following heat treatment at 120 °C and 400 °C with powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy including energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM/EDS), elemental analysis via inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-EA), and both 6Li and 27Al magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. The TEM/EDS and 27Al NMR data provide support for an aluminum-rich amorphous coating that, following drying at 120 °C, comprises six coordinated, partially hydrated aluminum environments. Heat treatment at 400 °C results in a phase that resembles partially fluorinated $\gamma$- or $\gamma$′-Al2O3, at least locally. An Al:F ratio of 2:1 is obtained in stark contrast to the ratio used in the original solution (1:3). No AlF3 is detected by PXRD and instead some evidence for a protonated phase (formed by ion exchanging protons for lithium) is detected along with Li[Li1/9Ni1/3Mn5/9]O2 after drying. This phase disappears on heating to 400 °C, suggesting some reorganization of bulk Li[Li1/9Ni1/3Mn5/9]O2 and possibly some incorporation of Al into the structure. This is in agreement with the 6Li NMR spectra, which indicate that the local environments that are found in the Ni-free end member of the series Li[Li(1/3−2x/3)NixMn(2/3−x/3)]O2 (i.e. Li2MnO3) are enhanced on sintering.},

abstract = {Nearly all high–energy density cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries are well-ordered materials in which lithium and other cations occupy distinct sites. Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their structures. The performance of Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 shows that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due to percolation of a certain type of active diffusion channels in disordered Li-excess materials. A unified understanding of high performance in both layered and Li-excess materials may enable the design of disordered-electrode materials with high capacity and high energy density.},

abstract = {Materials built from MO6 octahedra linked to XO4 tetrahedra are good candidates for studying the different factors that determine the electrode potential. Among them, olivine-like LiMPO4 (M = transition metal) phosphates are especially interesting. When pressure is applied to LiMPO4 (M = Ni and Fe), a phase transition is induced. However, instead of the well-known olivine ⇔ spinel transformation, a transition to a new phase is observed ($\beta$‘). The arrangements of the metal ions (including phosphorus) in the two structures are very similar; thus, the main difference between them is due to the oxygen arrangement in a similar matrix. Raman spectroscopy has confirmed the structural model proposed for the high-pressure phase, in particular the modification in the lithium coordination from 6- to 4-fold upon synthesis under pressure. Among the olivines LiMPO4 (M = Mn, Ni, and Fe), the iron-containing one is only active up to 5.1 V. On the other hand, none of the high-pressure materials is electrochemically active; this can be explained by the change in the electrostatic field at the transition metal position.},

challenge of clean renewable energy and environment pollution. Their
contemporary applications, for portable electronic devices, electric
vehicles, and large-scale power grids, stimulate the development of
high-performance battery materials with high energy density, high power,
good safety, and long lifetime. High-throughput calculations provide a
practical strategy to discover new battery materials and optimize
currently known material performances. Most cathode materials screened
by the previous high-throughput calculations cannot meet the requirement
of practical applications because only capacity, voltage and volume
change of bulk were considered. It is important to include more
structure-property relationships, such as point defects, surface and
interface, doping and metal-mixture and nanosize effects, in
high-throughput calculations. In this review, we established
quantitative description of structure-property relationships in Li-ion
battery materials by the intrinsic bulk parameters, which can be applied
in future high-throughput calculations to screen Li-ion battery
materials. Based on these parameterized structure-property
relationships, a possible high-throughput computational screening flow
path is proposed to obtain high-performance battery materials. In this
review, we discuss some quantitative descriptions of structure-property
relationships by the intrinsic bulk parameters, which can be applied in
the future high-throughput computational screening to obtain

abstract = {The provision of efficient electron and ion transport is a critical issue in an exciting new group of materials based on lithium metal phosphates that are important as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Much interest centres on olivine-type LiFePO(4), the most prominent member of this family. Whereas the one-dimensional lithium-ion mobility in this framework is high, the electronically insulating phosphate groups that benefit the voltage also isolate the redox centres within the lattice. The pristine compound is a very poor conductor (sigma approximately 10(-9) S cm(-1)), thus limiting its electrochemical response. One approach to overcome this is to include conductive phases, increasing its capacity to near-theoretical values. There have also been attempts to alter the inherent conductivity of the lattice by doping it with a supervalent ion. Compositions were reported to be black p-type semiconductors with conductivities of approximately 10(-2) S cm(-1) arising from minority Fe(3+) hole carriers. Our results for doped (and undoped) LiMPO(4) (M = Fe, Ni) show that a percolating nano-network of metal-rich phosphides are responsible for the enhanced conductivity. We believe our demonstration of non-carbonaceous-network grain-boundary conduction to be the first in these materials, and that it holds promise for other insulating phosphates.},

The present review gives the state of the art in the understanding of the properties of this material and the other members of the same family. We discuss the effects of the decrease of the size of the particles down to circa 20 nm; some of them have been misunderstood or are still open questions. All of them are important to determine the trends in the research and development on this family of materials in the future. The cells' properties are also reviewed with both the graphite and more recently the Li4Ti5O12anodes, the last one providing outstanding performance in terms of cycling life and power that make them promising not only for electric vehicles, but also to solve for intermittence locally in smart grids. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Cation-disordered lithium-excess metal oxides have recently emerged as a promising new class of high-energy-density cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, but the exploration of disordered materials has been hampered by their vast and unexplored composition space. This study proposes a practical methodology for the identification of stable cation-disordered rocksalts. Here, it is established that the efficient method, which makes use of special quasirandom structures, correctly predicts cation-ordering strengths in agreement with accurate Monte-Carlo simulations and experimental observations. By applying the approach to the composition space of ternary oxides with formula unit LiA0.5B0.5O2 (A, B: transition metals), this study discovers a previously unknown cation-disordered structure, LiCo0.5Zr0.5O2, that may function as the basis for a new class of cation-disordered cathode materials. This computational prediction is confirmed experimentally by solid-state synthesis and subsequent characterization by powder X-ray diffraction demonstrating the potential of the computational screening of large composition spaces for accelerating materials discovery.},

In order to identify the cathode material having the optimum Li cell performance we first varied the ratio between Li2MnO3 and LiMO2 segments of the composite oxides while maintaining the same metal ratio residing within their LiMO2 portions. The materials with the overall composition 0.5Li2MnO3{\textperiodcentered}0.5LiMO2 containing 0.5 mole of Li2MnO3 per mole of the composite metal oxide were found to be the optimum in terms of electrochemical performance. The electrochemical properties of these materials were further tuned by changing the relative amounts of Mn, Ni and Co in the LiMO2 segment to produce xLi2MnO3{\textperiodcentered}(1-x)LiMn0.50Ni0.35Co0.15O2 with enhanced capacities and rate capabilities. The rate capability of the lithium rich compound in which x = 0.3 was further increased by preparing electrodes with about 2 weight-percent multiwall carbon nanotube in the electrode. Lithium cells prepared with such electrodes were cycled at the 4C rate with little fade in capacity for over one hundred cycles.},

abstract = {Lithium ion batteries have shown great promise in electrical energy storage with enhanced energy density, power capacity, charge?discharge rates, and cycling lifetimes. However common fluid electrolytes consisting of lithium salts dissolved in solvents are toxic, corrosive, or flammable. Solid electrolytes with superionic conductivity can avoid those shortcomings and work with a metallic lithium anode, thereby allowing much higher energy densities. Here we present a novel class of solid electrolytes with three-dimensional conducting pathways based on lithium-rich anti-perovskites (LiRAP) with ionic conductivity of $\sigma$ {\textgreater} 10?3 S/cm at room temperature and activation energy of 0.2?0.3 eV. As temperature approaches the melting point, the ionic conductivity of the anti-perovskites increases to advanced superionic conductivity of $\sigma$ {\textgreater} 10?2 S/cm and beyond. The new crystalline materials can be readily manipulated via chemical, electronic, and structural means to boost ionic transport and serve as high-performance solid electrolytes for superionic Li+ conduction in electrochemistry applications.},

abstract = {Imperfect crystals behave statistically like liquid solutions, the crystal being the solvent and the imperfections the solutes. Application of the law of mass action to atomic and electronic reactions taking place in the crystal and between the crystal and the other phases leads to the notion that the concentrations of the various imperfections are interdependent as a result of reactions having partners in common. The consequences of this interdependence are demonstrated by means of a graphical method. Imperfections having opposite effective charges tend to increase each other's concentrations. Foreign atoms are incorporated in a manner dependent both on the energy levels caused by them and on the type of imperfection prevailing in the crystal in the absence of these foreign atoms. In monatomic solids the mechanism of incorporation can be influenced only through the temperature; in compounds it can also be influenced through the partial pressures of the components of the basis crystal. It is shown that these arguments given are valid irrespective of the type of bonding. {\textcopyright} 1958.},

The as-prepared and AlF 3 -coated Li-rich materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The as-prepared Li-rich oxide has a typical layered structure with the chemical formula of Li(Li 0.17 Ni 0.25 Mn 0.58 )O 2 , and the AlF 3 layer with a thickness of about 5-7 nm is coated on the surface of the Li(Li 0.17 Ni 0.25 Mn 0.58 )O 2 grains. Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests at various rates show that the AlF 3 -coated Li(Li 0.17 Ni 0.25 Mn 0.58 )O 2 has an obviously enhanced electrochemical performance compared with the as-prepared sample. At 0.2 C rate, the AlF 3 -coated sample provides a large capacity of more than 250 mAh g -1 . The coulombic efficiency in the initial cycle is improved to 89.5{\%} from 76.4{\%}. At 5 C rate, the reversible capacity of the AlF 3 -coated sample is stable at above 104 mAh g -1 after 200 cycles, much higher than that of the as-prepared sample. According to the analysis from electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), the improvements of the electrochemical performance are mainly attributed to the pre-activation of the Li-rich layered oxide induced by the AlF 3 coating and the maintenance of more active sites for the lithium ion intercalation/extraction in the AlF 3 -coated sample. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Over the past 30 years, significant commercial and academic progress has been made on Li-based battery technologies. From the early Li-metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li-based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next-generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium-ion battery chemistries.},

abstract = {Energy storage technologies smooth out fluctuations in the supply of energy from wind and solar power. This method of dis-tributing power generation reduces trans-mission losses, operating costs, and the environmental impact of overhead power lines. Since the price of lithium has tri-pled over the past decade, great concerns immediately arise about whether lithium resources are sufficient to support both sustainable transportation and electric storage markets. Due to the large abun-dance and low cost of sodium resources and similar chemical/electrochemical properties to established lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), room temperature sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a potential technology for grid-scale energy storage. [1–4] A large number of materials, such as transition metal oxides, [5–10] phos-phates, [11–14] ferrocyanides, [15–18] metal alloys, [19–21] and hard carbon, [22–24] have been investigated and have shown acceptable electrochemical performance, and some reviews have summarized recent developments in electrodes for SIBs. [25–28] However, due to the higher molar weight of the Na element and more positive standard electrochemical poten-tial of Na/Na + (compared to Li/Li +), SIBs exhibit lower energy densities than LIBs. Thus, SIB technology is quite suitable for stationary batteries in a grid-scale facility, where operation cost and longevity are the most important parameters for the device. In terms of cost and environmental impact, iron-based elec-trode materials seem the most ideal choice for large-scale battery systems. Iron is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Iron is located in the first transition series and exists in a wide range of oxidation states from −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Ar]3d 6 4s 2 , of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy. Thus, it can lose a variable number of electrons, and there is no clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable. In addition to the intrinsic environmen-tally friendly nature and low cost, another prominent feature of iron-based electrode materials is their diverse structures and compositions, leading to various electrochemical activities within different voltage ranges. Specifically, (i) with respect to cathode materials, layered oxides, polyanionic compounds, and ferrocya-nides have exhibited a suitable insertion potential and superior structural stability, ensuring the long-term cycling life of SIBs; (ii) for the anodes, oxides and sulfides present high capacity and acceptable stability characteristics for sodium storage. Grid-scale energy storage batteries with electrode materials made from low-cost, earth-abundant elements are needed to meet the requirements of sustainable energy systems. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with iron-based elec-trodes offer an attractive combination of low cost, plentiful structural diversity and high stability, making them ideal candidates for grid-scale energy storage systems. Although various iron-based cathode and anode materials have been synthesized and evaluated for sodium storage, further improvements are still required in terms of energy/power density and long cyclic stability for commercialization. In this Review, progress in iron-based electrode materials for SIBs, including oxides, polyanions, ferrocyanides, and sulfides, is briefly summarized. In addition, the reaction mechanisms, electrochemical perfor-mance enhancements, structure–composition–performance relationships, merits and drawbacks of iron-based electrode materials for SIBs are dis-cussed. Such iron-based electrode materials will be competitive and attractive electrodes for next-generation energy storage devices. Energy Storage},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 The Electrochemical Society. High energy densities of lithium-rich transition metal oxides cannot be sufficiently maintained on cycling due to high-voltage firstcycle activation and the subsequent structural changes. These changes can be seen as a continuous decrease of the average voltage with cycling, known as voltage fade. Electrochemical and chemical insertion of protons has been reported suggesting that protons generated in the electrolyte could be involved in electrochemical cyclingwhich could play a similar role in the "Li 2 MnO 3  component" of lithium rich transition metal oxides. Here, electrochemical insertion of structural protons, changes in lithium occupancy at various states of charge, and changes in local structure have been investigated via a combination of local probes including solid state NMR, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first principle calculations. While significant evidence is found for the deposition of non-structural proton-bearing species on electrodes, which accumulate with extensive cycling, structural proton insertion is not found to be a significant process directly effecting voltage fade. The electrochemical activity of disordered Li 2 MnO 3 , synthesized at low temperature, is also investigated and its Li removal/insertion properties measured quantitatively with NMR. Major reordering of Li sites and subsequent local structural transitions are observed by NMR and are found to be synchronous with voltage fade.},

abstract = {rock-salt structures, with Li + /TM evenly sharing cation sites and close-packed anion arrays, may be a reasonable alternative for effi cient Li + storage. After Li + extraction, the TM may remain at the cation sublattice sites and uphold well the disordered rock-salt framework. A recent work based on ab initio computations revealed that Li + transport can be facile in a disordered cubic rock-salt oxide (Li 1.211 Mo 0.467 Cr 0.3 O 2) with Li-excess. [ 8 ] It was found that such framework is stable with a maximum of 45{\%} of the cation sites vacant. Herein, we demonstrate that a new dilithium disordered rock-salt Li 2 VO 2 F intercalation material can deliver up to about 1.8 Li + capacity per TM (420 mAh g −1) at ≈2.5 V (1000 Wh kg −1) with only minor lattice volume change (≈3{\%}). Such material with mixed O 2− /F − anion environment has been synthesized by a simple ball-milling method. The two Li + storage with V 3+ /V 5+ redox reactions (Li 2 VO 2 F ↔ 2 Li + + 2e − + VO 2 F) leads to an attractively high theoretical capacity of 462 mAh g −1 . Moreover, Li 2 VO 2 F shows good capacity reten-tion and minor increase in polarization upon fast charging/dis-charging or upon low-temperature operation. The crystal structure of the target phase for the as-milled Li 2 VO 2 F is determined by Rietveld structural refi nement of powder neutron (Figure 1 a) and X-ray (Figure 1 b) diffraction patterns. The refi nement precludes a layered rock-salt structure (R -3 m space group) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). [ 11 ] Instead, the diffraction patterns can be well indexed in a dis-ordered cubic rock-salt phase (space group Fm -3 m , Table S1, Supporting Information). The atomic displacement param-eters were constrained to the same for all atoms in the course of the refi nements. As illustrated in the inset of Figure 1 a, Li and V atoms distribute randomly on the cationic sublattice (4 a Wyckoff sites) with a refi ned occupancy ratio of 0.64:0.36. The accurate occupancy refi nements for O and F on the anionic sublattice (4 b sites) cannot be obtained from the diffraction data because O and F have low contrast in scattering properties for X-rays and neutrons. [ 12 ] On an average, cations are coordinated with four O and two F atoms to form the (Li/V)O 4 F 2 octahe-dral units in the stoichiometric Li 2 VO 2 F. In addition, the refi ne-ment yields a material density of 4.25 g cm −3 as compared with 5 g cm −3 for LiCoO 2 and 3.5 g cm −3 for LiFePO 4 . [ 13 ] High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image shows the nanocrystalline character (≈10 nm) of the as-synthesized Li 2 VO 2 F (Figure 1 c). The cubic structure of Li 2 VO 2 F was also confi rmed by the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) image (inset in Figure 1 c). Some nanocrystals (marked with white circle in Figure 1 c) show clear stacking faults, arising probably from the local distortion of (Li/V)O x F y octahedra. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Figure 1 d) Advanced cathode materials with superior energy storage capa-bility are highly demanded for mobile and stationary applica-tions. The inherent structural feature of Li + hosts is critical for the battery performance. High-capacity conversion cathode materials often encounter large voltage hysteresis (low energy effi ciency) accompanied with the structural reconstruction. [ 1 ] The current commercial cathode materials are still dominated by intercalation materials with intrinsic structural integrity for accommodating Li + . [ 2 ] However, the known intercalation materials have limited theoretical capacity ({\textless}300 mAh g −1). [ 3 ] In addition, structural transition/degradation have often been observed for the common intercalation hosts with ordered Li + / transition metal (TM) lattice sites. Antisite disorder (Li + sites/ layers occupied by TM ions) in olivines can block the 1D Li + dif-fusion path. [ 4 ] The activation barrier for Li + diffusion in layered oxides is sensitive to the Li-content, the spacing of the oxygen layers and the interlayer cationic disorder. [ 5 ] Cationic reloca-tion [ 6 ] and irreversible order–disorder transitions [ 7,8 ] often occur in layered oxides upon cycling. The near complete Li + extrac-tion from the ordered sites/layers is concomitant with a large lattice volume change, [ 2 ] phase transition, [ 9 ] and even crystal structure collapse. [ 10 ] It is desirable to develop new intercalation materials with better structural tolerance for Li + uptake/release and meanwhile enhanced lithium storage capability. Disordered},

In light of possible concerns over rising lithium costs in the future, Na and Na-ion batteries have re-emerged as candidates for medium and large-scale stationary energy storage, especially as a result of heightened interest in renewable energy sources that provide intermittent power which needs to be load-levelled. The sodium-ion battery field presents many solid state materials design challenges, and rising to that call in the past couple of years, several reports of new sodium-ion technologies and electrode materials have surfaced. These range from high-temperature air electrodes to new layered oxides, polyanion-based materials, carbons and other insertion materials for sodium-ion batteries, many of which hold promise for future sodium-based energy storage applications. In this article, the challenges of current high-temperature sodium technologies including Na-S and Na-NiCl2and new molten sodium technology, Na-O2are summarized.

Real-world success necessitates the holistic mastering of this electrochemistry's kinetics, thermodynamics, and stability. Here we prove oxygen redox reactivity in the archetypical lithium-and manganese-rich layered cathodes through bulk-sensitive synchrotron based spectroscopies, and elucidate their complete anionic/cationic charge-compensation mechanism. Furthermore, via various electroanalytical methods, we answer how the anionic/cationic interplay governs application-wise important issues-namely sluggish kinetics, large hysteresis, and voltage fade-that afflict these promising cathodes despite widespread industrial and academic efforts. We find that cationic redox is kinetically fast and without hysteresis unlike sluggish anions, which furthermore show different oxidation vs. reduction potentials. Additionally, more time spent with fully oxidized oxygen promotes voltage fade. These fundamental insights about anionic redox are indispensable for improving lithium-rich cathodes. Moreover, our methodology provides guidelines for assessing the merits of existing and future anionic redox-based high-energy cathodes, which are being discovered rapidly.},

abstract = {Since their market introduction in 1991, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have developed evolutionary in terms of their specific energies (Wh/kg) and energy densities (Wh/L). Currently, they do not only dominate the small format battery market for portable electronic devices, but have also been successfully implemented as the technology of choice for electromobility as well as for stationary energy storage. Besides LIBs, a variety of different technologically promising battery concepts exists that, depending on the respective tech-nology, might also be suitable for various application pur-poses. These systems of the Bnext generation,{\^{}} the so-called post-lithium ion batteries (PLIBs), such as metal/sulfur, metal/ air or metal/oxygen, or Bpost-lithium technologies{\^{}} (systems without Li), which are based on alternative single (Na + , K +) or multivalent ions (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+), are currently being studied intensively. From today's point of view, it seems quite clear that there will not only be a single technology for all applica-tions (technology monopoly), but different battery systems, which can be especially suitable or combined for a particular application (technology diversity). In this review, we place the lithium ion technology in a historical context and give insights into the battery technology diversity that evolved during the past decades and which will, in turn, influence future research and development.},

abstract = {Lithium manganite, Li2MnO3, is an attractive cathode material for rechargeable lithium ion batteries due to its large capacity, low cost and low toxicity. We employed well-established atomistic simulation techniques to examine defect processes, favourable dopants on the Mn site and lithium ion diffusion pathways in Li2MnO3. The Li Frenkel, which is necessary for the formation of Li vacancies in vacancy-assisted Li ion diffusion, is calculated to be the most favourable intrinsic defect (1.21 eV/defect). The cation intermixing is calculated to be the second most favourable defect process. High lithium ionic conductivity with a low activation energy of 0.44 eV indicates that a Li ion can be extracted easily in this material. To increase the capacity, trivalent dopants (Al3+, Co3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, In3+, Y3+, Gd3+ and La3+) were considered to create extra Li in Li2MnO3. The present calculations show that Al3+ is an ideal dopant for this strategy and that this is in agreement with the experiential study of Al-doped Li2MnO3. The favourable isovalent dopants are found to be the Si4+ and the Ge4+ on the Mn site.},

abstract = {Electrode materials based on Li-rich layered oxides are of growing interest for high-energy Li-ion battery applications because of their staggering capacities associated with the emergence of a novel, reversible anionic process. However, the fundamental science at work behind this new process needs to be well understood for further optimization. Here we report on the redox mechanisms in high-capacity Li-rich materials Li 2 Ru 1−x M x O 3 and Li 2 Ir 1−x M x O 3 , by combining X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) core peaks and valence intensity analyses. We fully confirm that these materials electrochemically react with Li via cumulative reversible cationic/anionic redox processes, but more importantly we reveal that, depending on the nature of the metal (Ru or Ir), there is a delicate balance between metal and oxygen contributions. For instance, we show a greater implication of oxide ions for Ir-based electrodes, consistent with the higher covalent character of Ir−O bonds compared to Ru−O bonds. We equally provide evidence that the oxygen redox process is responsible for the high capacity displayed by the Li-rich NMC Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn 0.54 O 2 electrodes that are serious contenders for the next generation of Li-ion batteries. These combined results highlight the benefit of collecting both XPS core and valence spectra for a better understanding of anionic redox mechanisms in Li-rich layered oxides. ■ INTRODUCTION Layered lithium transition metal oxides LiMO 2 (where M is composed of transition metals) with low molecular weight, high capacity, and reversibility are one of the best suitable electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. The first commercial Li-ion battery was assembled using LiCoO 2 (∼140 mAh/g) as positive electrode material and graphite as negative. Since then, major advances in enhancing the capacity of layered transition metal oxides have been achieved via chemical substitution. First, the partial replacement of Co 3+ with Ni 2+ and Mn 4+ has led to the Li(Ni 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3)O 2 layered oxides, coined as NMC, which display capacities as high as 200 mAh/g. More recently, further explorations of cationic substitutions in the layered oxide systems have led to materials made of Ni, Co, and Mn with some Li in the transition metal layers, in addition to the Li present in the van der Waals gap, termed as " Li-rich NMC " and showing capacities exceeding 250 mAh/g or greater. 1,2 Such Li-rich NMC electrodes are regarded as serious contenders for next-generation Li-ion batteries. The redox chemistry asso-ciated with the lithium insertion/deinsertion process of these Li-rich phases has been analyzed by our group recently using complementary techniques like X-ray photoemission spectros-copy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) on a model compound Li 2 Ru (1−x) Sn x O 3 . 3 The results in association with structural analysis and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations have revealed the existence of cumulative cationic and anionic reversible redox processes (Ru 4+ /Ru 5+ and O},

In addition to policy support, widespread deployment of electric vehicles requires high-performance and low-cost energy storage technologies, including not only batteries but also alternative electrochemical devices. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of various batteries and hydrogen fuel cells that have the greatest potential to succeed in commercial applications. Three sectors that are not well served by current lithium-ion-powered electric vehicles, namely the long-range, low-cost and high-utilization transportation markets, are discussed. The technological properties that must be improved to fully enable these electric vehicle markets include specific energy, cost, safety and power grid compatibility. Six energy storage and conversion technologies that possess varying combinations of these improved characteristics are compared and separately evaluated for each market. The remainder of the Review briefly discusses the technological status of these clean energy technologies, emphasizing barriers that must be overcome.},

Of these factors, transition metal (TM) ion migration toward the interior of the particle and hence formation of TM-densified surface layers, triggered by oxygen loss, is thermodynamically probable.

Conventional cathodes of Li-ion batteries mainly operate through an insertion-extraction process involving transition metal redox. These cathodes will not be able to meet the increasing requirements until lithium-rich layered oxides emerge with beyond-capacity performance. Nevertheless, in-depth understanding of the evolution of crystal and excess capacity delivered by Li-rich layered oxides is insufficient. Herein, various in situ technologies such as X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy are employed for a typical material Li 1.2 Ni 0.2 Mn 0.6 O 2 , directly visualizing O - -O - (peroxo oxygen dimers) bonding mostly along the c-axis and demonstrating the reversible O 2- /O - redox process. Additionally, the formation of the peroxo O-O bond is calculated via density functional theory, and the corresponding O-O bond length of ≈1.3 {\AA} matches well with the in situ Raman results. These findings enrich the oxygen chemistry in layered oxides and open opportunities to design high-performance positive electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.},

In addition, the ratio of Li atoms to Ni, Mn atoms in the material increases with y at fixed x, suggesting the formation of Mn4+ as y increases. The cation mixing and the presence of Mn4+ profoundly affects the electrochemical deintercalation of Li from LixMnyNi1-yO2.

abstract = { As this MRS Bulletin issue on “Advanced Materials for Energy Storage” was being finalized, the North American continent suffered one of its warmest summers ever recorded. The past two to three years have also been the warmest on record, August 1999 being the 21st consecutive month with above-average temperatures. Such deviations could be quite natural. Indeed, these temperature increases can be explained in part by increased solar activity. Yet, burning of fossil fuels and other human factors are considered likely contributors. Whether from human activities or cosmic effects, for human survival, technological solutions may be needed to keep the global temperature within tolerable margins. In a parallel development, the price of oil on the New York market has nearly doubled since the beginning of 1999. This current increase is directly related to self-controls imposed by the oil-producing countries. The price will probably not climb to excessive values, mainly because the oil-producing countries do not want other nations to develop competitive alternative technologies. However, these increases in oil prices could have devastating effects on the general economy, and again, the future is unpredictable.This situation poses an interesting dilemma for the scientific community. Scientists are trained to base conclusions on facts and respond with appropriate engineering solutions. Yet the extrapolation of global climate change is far from conclusive; the economies of nations can be volatile and often are determined by politics as opposed to science; and the needs of individual nations are varied and continue to evolve based on their local resources, economies, and environmental regulations.},

abstract = {Cumulative anionic/cationic bulk redox processes lead to the outstanding specific energy (1000 Wh kg −1) of Li-rich Mn-based layered oxides as lithium-ion battery cathodes. Previous attempts to quantify redox processes in these materials were either limited to initial cycles or relied solely on the transition metals. It thus remains unclear to what extent does oxygen redox persist over cycling. This study provides an answer via synchrotron-based bulk-sensitive hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) by directly following the changes in the electronic state of lattice oxygen. We find that oxygen redox contribution stabilizes after initial cycles in Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Mn 0.54 Co 0.13 O 2 (Li-rich NMC), and even after 70 cycles, it accounts for more than one-third of the overall capacity. Consequently, we observe a gradual but limited growth of Mn 3+/4+ redox, instead of a complete activation. Partial degradation of the Ni 2+/3+/4+ redox is also detected. This fundamental study generates optimism for the concept of anionic redox in long-cycling batteries and also highlights the capability of HAXPES for understanding bulk versus surface effects in energy materials. A nionic redox in transition-metal oxides has lately emerged as a promising concept of solid-state electrochemistry to design materials for energy storage and conversion. 1 It has unlocked the possibility to reversibly and repeatedly perform (de)intercalation reactions via the redox activity of bulk oxide anions, in addition to the conventionally utilized transition-metal redox. The energy storage limit of such oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries has thus been increased, and the materials design space has also been widened. 2 Subsequent to our group's fundamental investigations on "model" materials based on 4d and 5d transition-metal layered oxides, 3 several studies 4−11 have now proven that lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxides, such as Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Mn 0.54 Co 0.13 O 2 (Li-rich NMC) that is derived from Li 2 MnO 3 , also exhibit combined anionic/cationic redox activity to deliver reversible capacities above 270 mAh g −1 and approach 1000 Wh kg −1 of specific energy at the material level. 12−18 These attributes, along with the limited use of scarce cobalt and nickel, make the Li-rich NMC family a strong competitor of today's Ni-based layered oxides 19 (NMCs) that are derived from LiNiO 2. NMCs are also undergoing rapid innovation owing to their promise of up to 800 Wh kg −1 at the material level. 2,12 Therefore, for Li-rich cathodes to stay relevant in this duel, 2 several obstacles need to be eliminated, namely, insufficient electrode density, 12 large voltage hyste-resis, 8,20 sluggish kinetics, 8,21 and voltage decay upon aging. 22 In this study, we focus on the aging behavior of Li-rich NMC, particularly on how the anionic/cationic redox activities evolve over cycling, which is essential for the fundamental understanding of degradation mechanisms. Most reports on anionic redox in these materials were limited to the investigation of charge-compensation in the first couple of cycles. 4−11 Although a recent study reported redox evolutions over long cycling, it relied on transition metals' spectra because the direct quantification of oxygen spectra was not possible. 23 Among the spectroscopic techniques that have been adopted by the battery community specifically for the direct character},

@article{Goodenough2013,
abstract = {Each cell of a battery stores electrical energy as chemical energy in two electrodes, a reductant (anode) and an oxidant (cathode), separated by an electrolyte that transfers the ionic component of the chemical reaction inside the cell and forces the electronic component outside the battery. The output on discharge is an external electronic current I at a voltage V for a time $\Delta$t. The chemical reaction of a rechargeable battery must be reversible on the application of a charging I and V. Critical parameters of a rechargeable battery are safety, density of energy that can be stored at a specific power input and retrieved at a specific power output, cycle and shelf life, storage efficiency, and cost of fabrication. Conventional ambient-temperature rechargeable batteries have solid electrodes and a liquid electrolyte. The positive electrode (cathode) consists of a host framework into which the mobile (working) cation is inserted reversibly over a finite solid-solution range. The solid-solution range, which is reduced at higher current by the rate of transfer of the working ion across electrode/electrolyte interfaces and within a host, limits the amount of charge per electrode formula unit that can be transferred over the time $\Delta$t = $\Delta$t(I). Moreover, the difference between energies of the LUMO and the HOMO of the electrolyte, i.e., electrolyte window, determines the maximum voltage for a long shelf and cycle life. The maximum stable voltage with an aqueous electrolyte is 1.5 V; the Li-ion rechargeable battery uses an organic electrolyte with a larger window, which increase the density of stored energy for a given $\Delta$t. Anode or cathode electrochemical potentials outside the electrolyte window can increase V, but they require formation of a passivating surface layer that must be permeable to Li(+) and capable of adapting rapidly to the changing electrode surface area as the electrode changes volume during cycling. A passivating surface layer adds to the impedance of the Li(+) transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface and lowers the cycle life of a battery cell. Moreover, formation of a passivation layer on the anode robs Li from the cathode irreversibly on an initial charge, further lowering the reversible $\Delta$t. These problems plus the cost of quality control of manufacturing plague development of Li-ion rechargeable batteries that can compete with the internal combustion engine for powering electric cars and that can provide the needed low-cost storage of electrical energy generated by renewable wind and/or solar energy. Chemists are contributing to incremental improvements of the conventional strategy by investigating and controlling electrode passivation layers, improving the rate of Li(+) transfer across electrode/electrolyte interfaces, identifying electrolytes with larger windows while retaining a Li(+) conductivity $\sigma$(Li) {\textgreater} 10(-3) S cm(-1), synthesizing electrode morphologies that reduce the size of the active particles while pinning them on current collectors of large surface area accessible by the electrolyte, lowering the cost of cell fabrication, designing displacement-reaction anodes of higher capacity that allow a safe, fast charge, and designing alternative cathode hosts. However, new strategies are needed for batteries that go beyond powering hand-held devices, such as using electrode hosts with two-electron redox centers; replacing the cathode hosts by materials that undergo displacement reactions (e.g. sulfur) by liquid cathodes that may contain flow-through redox molecules, or by catalysts for air cathodes; and developing a Li(+) solid electrolyte separator membrane that allows an organic and aqueous liquid electrolyte on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Opportunities exist for the chemist to bring together oxide and polymer or graphene chemistry in imaginative morphologies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society. The demonstration of reversible anionic redox in Li-rich layered oxides has revitalized the search for higher energy battery cathodes. To advance the fundamentals of this promising mechanism, we investigate herein the cationic-anionic redox processes in Li2Ru0.75Sn0.25O3 - a model Li-rich layered cathode in which Ru (cationic) and O (anionic) are the only redox-active sites. We reveal its charge compensation mechanism and local structural evolutions by applying operando (and complementary ex situ) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Among other local effects, the anionic-oxidation-driven distortion of the oxygen network around Ru atoms is thereby visualized. Oxidation of lattice oxygen is also directly proven via hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). Furthermore, we demonstrate a spectroscopy-driven visualization of electrochemical reaction paths, which enabled us to neatly decouple the individual cationic-anionic dQ/dV contributions during cycling. We hence establish the redox and structural origins of all dQ/dV features and demonstrate the vital role of anionic redox in hysteresis and kinetics. These fundamental insights about Li-rich systems are crucial for improving the existing anionic-redox-based cathodes and evaluating the ones being discovered rapidly.},

However, there is significant debate regarding their redox chemistry. It is apparent that the mechanism of lithium extraction from lithium-rich Li2MnO3 is not fully understood, especially in relation to the observed O2 evolution and structural transformation. Here, delithiation and kinetic processes in Li2MnO3 are investigated using ab initio simulation techniques employing high level hybrid functionals as they reproduce accurately the electronic structure of oxygen hole states. We show that Li extraction is charge-compensated by oxidation of the oxide anion, so that the overall delithiation reaction involves lattice oxygen loss. Localized holes on oxygen (O–) are formed as the first step but are not stable leading to oxygen dimerization (with O–O ∼ 1.3 {\AA}) and eventually to the formation of molecular O2.

However, large density-of-state due to flat bands leads to large transport effective mass, which results in a simultaneous decrease of mobility. In fact, the net effect of such a high effective mass is a lower thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, when the carriers are predominantly scattered by phonons according to the deformation potential theory of Bardeen–Shockley. We demonstrate that the beneficial effect of light effective mass contributes to high zT in n-type thermoelectric PbTe, where doping and temperature can be used to tune the effective mass. This clear demonstration of the deformation potential theory to thermoelectrics shows that the guiding principle for band structure engineering should be low effective mass along the transport direction.},

The samples are interpreted using opto-analytical techniques and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis proves that this well-elaborated technique makes it possible to achieve a continuous NiO surface coverage of 8–10 nm, a result that contributes towards solving the chronic electrochemical problems of 4.8 V cathode material. Our data reveal that NiO-coated LiCoPO4cathode demonstrates superior cycle stability and specific capacity at relatively low rates. The 2.5{\%} wt.

However, they suffer from structural changes that lead to substantial voltage fade. In this study, we use stress as a novel way to track irreversible changes in Li1.2Mn0.55Ni0.125Co0.125O2(LR-NMC) cathodes. A unique and unpredicted stress signature is observed during the first delithiation. Initially, a tensile stress is observed, consistent with volume contraction from lithium removal, however, the stress reverses and becomes compressive with continued charging beyond 4 V vs Li/Li+, indicating volume expansion; this phenomenon is present in the first cycle only. This irreversible stress during delithiation is likely to be at least partially due to oxygen loss and the resulting cation rearrangement. Raman spectroscopy provides evidence of the layered-to-spinel phase transition after cycling in the LR-NMC films, as well as recovery of the original spectra upon re-annealing in an oxygen environment.},

abstract = {Energy production and storage technologies have attracted a great deal of attention for day-to-day applications. In recent decades, advances in lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology have improved living conditions around the globe. LIBs are used in most mobile electronic devices as well as in zero-emission electronic vehicles. However, there are increasing concerns regarding load leveling of renewable energy sources and the smart grid as well as the sustainability of lithium sources due to their limited availability and consequent expected price increase. Therefore, whether LIBs alone can satisfy the rising demand for small- and/or mid-to-large-format energy storage applications remains unclear. To mitigate these issues, recent research has focused on alternative energy storage systems. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as the best candidate power sources because sodium is widely available and exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs; therefore, SIBs are promising next-generation alternatives. Recently, sodiated layer transition metal oxides, phosphates and organic compounds have been introduced as cathode materials for SIBs. Simultaneously, recent developments have been facilitated by the use of select carbonaceous materials, transition metal oxides (or sulfides), and intermetallic and organic compounds as anodes for SIBs. Apart from electrode materials, suitable electrolytes, additives, and binders are equally important for the development of practical SIBs. Despite developments in electrode materials and other components, there remain several challenges, including cell design and electrode balancing, in the application of sodium ion cells. In this article, we summarize and discuss current research on materials and propose future directions for SIBs. This will provide important insights into scientific and practical issues in the development of SIBs.},

abstract = {The ever-growing demand for advanced rechargeable lithium-ion batteries in portable electronics and electric vehicles has spurred intensive research efforts on high-voltage positive electrode materials over the past decade.The ever-growing demand for advanced rechargeable lithium-ion batteries in portable electronics and electric vehicles has spurred intensive research efforts over the past decade. The key to sustaining the progress in Li-ion batteries lies in the quest for safe, low-cost positive electrode (cathode) materials with desirable energy and power capabilities. One approach to boost the energy and power densities of batteries is to increase the output voltage while maintaining a high capacity, fast charge–discharge rate, and long service life. This review gives an account of the various emerging high-voltage positive electrode materials that have the potential to satisfy these requirements either in the short or long term, including nickel-rich layered oxides, lithium-rich layered oxides, high-voltage spinel oxides, and high-voltage polyanionic compounds. The key barriers and the corresponding strategies for the practical viability of these cathode materials are discussed along with the optimization of electrolytes and other cell components, with a particular emphasis on recent advances in the literature. A concise perspective with respect to plausible strategies for future developments in the field is also provided.},

abstract = {The recently discovered lithium-rich cathode material Li7Mn(BO3)3 has a high theoretical capacity and an unusual tetrahedral Mn(2+) coordination. Atomistic simulation and density functional theory (DFT) techniques are employed to provide insights into the defect and redox chemistry, the structural changes upon lithium extraction and the mechanisms of lithium ion diffusion. The most favourable intrinsic defects are Li/Mn anti-site pairs, where Li and Mn ions occupy interchanged positions, and Li Frenkel defects. DFT calculations reproduce the experimental cell voltage and confirm the presence of the unusually high Mn(V) redox state, which corresponds to a theoretical capacity of nearly 288 mA h g(-1). The ability to reach the high manganese oxidation state is related to both the initial tetrahedral coordination of Mn and the observed distortion/tilting of the BO3 units to accommodate the contraction of the Mn-O bonds upon oxidation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate fast three-dimensional lithium diffusion in line with the good rate performance observed.},

In particular, the importance of the electrolytes and their associated interfaces with electrodes as well as their effects on the battery performance are emphasized by in-depth discussion and data analysis. To overcome the challenges, several possible research directions are also suggested for facilitating further improvement on the battery performance.},

Within this approach, two configurations are considered equivalent when they are related by an isometric operation; a trial list of possible isometric transformations is provided by the group of symmetry operators in the parent structure, which is used to generate all configurations via atomic substitutions. We have adapted the equations for configurational statistics to operate in the reduced configurational space of the independent configurations. Each configuration in this space is characterized by its reduced energy, which includes not only its energy but also a contribution from its degeneracy in the complete configurational space, via an entropic term. The new computer program SOD (site- occupancy disorder) is presented, which performs this analysis in systems with arbitrary symmetry and any size of supercell. As a case study we use the distribution of cations in iron antimony oxide FeSbO4, where we also introduce some general considerations for the modelling of site- occupancy disorder in paramagnetic systems.},

B 77 224115 (2008) (which applies only to Bravais lattices), this approach applies to arbitrary multilattices. The algorithm enumerates superlattices and atomic configurations using permutation groups rather than direct geometric comparisons. The key concept is to use the quotient group associated with each superlattice to determine all unique atomic configurations. The algorithm is very efficient; the run time scales linearly with the number of unique structures found. We demonstrate the algorithm in the important case of hcp-derived superstructures. In the list of enumerated hexagonal-close-packed derivative superstructures, we predict several as-yet-unobserved structures as likely candidates for new intermetallic prototypes.},

abstract = {The increasing interest in energy storage for the grid can be attributed to multiple factors, including the capital costs of managing peak demands, the investments needed for grid reliability, and the integration of renewable energy sources. Although existing energy storage is dominated by pumped hydroelectric, there is the recognition that battery systems can offer a number of high-value opportunities, provided that lower costs can be obtained. The battery systems reviewed here include sodium-sulfur batteries that are commercially available for grid applications, redox-flow batteries that offer low cost, and lithium-ion batteries whose development for commercial electronics and electric vehicles is being applied to grid storage. T he August 2003 blackout in the Northeast and the recent September 2011 power fail-ure that extended from Southern Califor-nia to Mexico and Arizona are two of the more widely publicized examples in which power outages affected many millions of consumers. From a broader perspective, such power out-age events underscore the complex set of issues associated with the generation and use of elec-tricity: the reliability of the grid, the use of fossil fuels and related carbon emissions, the develop-ment of electric vehicles to decrease dependence on foreign oil, and the increased deployment of renewable energy resources. Underlying these considerations is the recognition that inexpen-sive and reliable energy is vital for economic development. Moreover, most of these issues are international in scope, with the additional caveat that worldwide demand for electricity is projected to double by 2050. Electrical energy storage (EES) cannot pos-sibly address all of these matters. However, ener-gy storage does offer a well-established approach for improving grid reliability and utilization. Whereas transmission and distribution systems are responsible for moving electricity over dis-tances to end users, the EES systems involve a time dimension, providing electricity when it is needed. A recent study identified a number of high-value applications for energy storage, ranging from the integration of renewable energy sources to power quality and reliability (1). De-spite the anticipated benefits and needs, there are relatively few storage installations in opera-tion in the United States. Only {\~{}}2.5{\%} of the total electric power delivered in the United States uses energy storage, most of which is limited to pumped hydroelectric storage. This is far below the energy storage levels in Europe (10{\%}) and Japan (15{\%}), where more favorable economics and policies are in place (2). Energy storage technologies available for large-scale applications can be divided into four types: mechanical, electrical, chemical, and elec-trochemical (3). Pumped hydroelectric systems account for 99{\%} of a worldwide storage capac-ity of 127,000 MW of discharge power. Com-pressed air storage is a distant second at 440 MW. The characteristics for several of these EES sys-tems in terms of power rating, which identifies potential applications, and duration of discharge are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Here, delithiation and kinetic processes in Li2MnO3 are investigated using ab initio simulation techniques employing high level hybrid functionals as they reproduce accurately the electronic structure of oxygen hole states. We show that Li extraction is charge-compensated by oxidation of the oxide anion, so that the overall delithiation reaction involves lattice oxygen loss. Localized holes on oxygen (O–) are formed as the first step but are not stable leading to oxygen dimerization (with O–O ∼ 1.3 {\AA}) and eventually to the formation of molecular O2.

This is especially true in the past decade. Early on, carbonaceous materials dominated the negative electrode and hence most of the possible improvements in the cell were anticipated at the positive terminal; on the other hand, major developments in negative electrode materials made in the last portion of the decade with the introduction of nanocomposite Sn/C/Co alloys and Si-C composites have demanded higher capacity positive electrodes to match. Much of this was driven by the consumer market for small portable electronic devices. More recently, there has been a growing interest in developing Li-sulfur and Li-air batteries that have the potential for vastly increased capacity and energy density, which is needed to power large-scale systems. These require even more complex assemblies at the positive electrode in order to achieve good properties. This review provides an overview of the major developments in the area of positive electrode materials in both Li-ion and Li batteries in the past decade, and particularly in the past few years.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that LiNiPO 4 phase is well crystallized, phase purity supported by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental mapping by scanning electron transmission electron microscopy (STEM). For the first time, we have carried out direct visualization of atom-by-atom structural observation of LiNiPO 4 nanomaterials using high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) and annular bright-field (ABF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis.

The most favourable defect types are found to be the Li Frenkel and off-stoichiometry (Li-excess) disorder, suggesting that interstitial lithium is possible in the cryolite structure, and is important in rationalizing the lithium intercalation chemistry.

The resulting model does not have a fixed functional form and hence is capable of modeling complex potential energy landscapes. It is systematically improvable with more data. We apply the method to bulk carbon, silicon and germanium and test it by calculating properties of the crystals at high temperatures.

However, the highest energy storage possible for Li-ion batteries is insufficient for the long-term needs of society, for example, extended-range electric vehicles. To go beyond the horizon of Li-ion batteries is a formidable challenge; there are few options. Here we consider two: Li-air (O(2)) and Li-S. The energy that can be stored in Li-air (based on aqueous or non-aqueous electrolytes) and Li-S cells is compared with Li-ion; the operation of the cells is discussed, as are the significant hurdles that will have to be overcome if such batteries are to succeed. Fundamental scientific advances in understanding the reactions occurring in the cells as well as new materials are key to overcoming these obstacles. The potential benefits of Li-air and Li-S justify the continued research effort that will be needed.},

Li-ion conductivity is shown to significantly exceed Na-ion conductivity, with the highest conductivities found for Li3OCl and Li3OBr. The effect of Cl/Br mixing on conductivity is shown to be small but could be used to fine-tune the activation energy. Both low conductivities and high activation energy barriers are found for the mixed Li/Na systems, which suggests that they would make poor solid electrolytes.

abstract = {R eversible redox chemistry in solids under highly oxidizing conditions (for example versus H 2 /H + , Li/Li + or O 2) is a powerful tool in (electro)chemical systems, increasing the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution and methane functionalization (elec-tro)catalysts as well as the energy and power densities of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) 1. In LIBs in particular, employing high-voltage redox has been identified as a promising avenue to meeting the energy density demands of next-generation technologies such as plug-in electric vehicles. Recently, anionic oxygen redox has been shown to offer access to substantial high-voltage (de)intercalation capacity in a range of electrode materials 2-7 , spurring an intense research effort to understand this phenomenon. While many oxygen-redox-active materials have been developed, they almost universally exhibit a host of irreversible electrochemical behaviours such as voltage hysteresis and voltage fade 8. This is most notable in the anion-redox-active Li-rich layered oxides, Li 1+x M 1−x O 2 (M is a transition metal (TM) or non-TM such as Al, Sn or Mg), which exhibit capacities approaching 300 mAh g −1 but have yet to achieve commercial success due to such electrochemical behaviours 5,9. It has been shown both experimentally 10-12 and from first-principles thermodynamics 13 that the migration of M into empty Li sites 9-creating structural disorder in the form of M Li-V M antisite-cation-vacancy point-defect pairs-is at the root of voltage profile evolution and depression, particularly during the first cycle. Oxygen redox has separately been shown to trigger voltage hysteresis and sluggish kinetics 8,14 , with the implication being that oxygen redox and TM migration-vacancy formation are often intrinsically linked. Indeed, coupling between oxygen redox, cation migration and voltage hysteresis was recently observed 6. However, under the two primary models that have emerged to describe the nature of the lattice oxygen in these materials (either an approximately 2.5 {\AA} peroxo-like O 2 n-dimer 3,15 or an isolated O-anion 4,5,16), it is unclear as to why the oxidation of oxygen should lead to the correlated structural transformations and voltage hysteresis. It has been argued qualitatively that the oxidation of oxygen destabilizes the layered structure 2,15 ; however, a robust understanding of the materials design criteria for achieving structurally and electrochemically reversible anion redox remains elusive. In approaching this issue, we turn to layered Li 2 IrO 3 (equiva-lently, Li[Li 0.33 Ir 0.67 ]O 2 or LIO), which is reported to exhibit anion redox, yet unlike other Li-rich layered oxides exhibits highly reversible structural and electrochemical behaviour during cycling 15,17. Upon substituting redox-inactive Sn for Ir, the solid-solution material Li 2 Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 (LISO) forms M Li-V M defects during charge, accompanied by voltage hysteresis during subsequent cycling that is typical of other anion-redox-active oxides 15. This tunability makes LIO/LISO an ideal model system for studying the link between anion redox, local structure and irreversible electrochemistry. Reversible high-voltage redox chemistry is an essential component of many electrochemical technologies, from (electro)cata-lysts to lithium-ion batteries. Oxygen-anion redox has garnered intense interest for such applications, particularly lithium-ion batteries, as it offers substantial redox capacity at more than 4 V versus Li/Li + in a variety of oxide materials. However, oxidation of oxygen is almost universally correlated with irreversible local structural transformations, voltage hysteresis and voltage fade, which currently preclude its widespread use. By comprehensively studying the Li 2−x Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 model system, which exhibits tunable oxidation state and structural evolution with y upon cycling, we reveal that this structure-redox coupling arises from the local stabilization of short approximately 1.8 {\AA} metal-oxygen $\pi$ bonds and approximately 1.4 {\AA} O-O dimers during oxygen redox, which occurs in Li 2−x Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 through ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Crucially, formation of these oxidized oxygen species necessitates the decoordination of oxygen to a single covalent bonding partner through formation of vacancies at neighbouring cation sites, driving cation disorder. These insights establish a point-defect explanation for why anion redox often occurs alongside local structural disordering and voltage hysteresis during cycling. Our findings offer an explanation for the unique electrochemical properties of lithium-rich layered oxides, with implications generally for the design of materials employing oxygen redox chemistry.

Electrospinning is a particularly low cost, simple, and versatile method to produce nanofibers from various kinds of materials, and the improved coaxial electrospinning can fabricate nanotubes and core/shell structural nanofibers. This review highlights research into the use of electrospinning to create nanofibers for the applications in energy-related devices, mainly including dye-sensitized solar cells, fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. Additionally, the application of NFMs derived from electrospinning in other areas, such as hydrogen storage and lithium-air batteries, are also discussed. At last, the limitations and future prospects for large-scale applications of NFMs by electrospinning are proposed.},

Here, delithiation and kinetic processes in Li2MnO3 are investigated using ab initio simulation techniques employing high level hybrid functionals as they reproduce accurately the electronic structure of oxygen hole states. We show that Li extraction is charge-compensated by oxidation of the oxide anion, so that the overall delithiation reaction involves lattice oxygen loss.

Nevertheless, the structural and chemical origin of the process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, we demonstrate how very specific local Li-excess environments around oxygen atoms necessarily lead to labile oxygen electrons that can be more easily extracted and participate in the practical capacity of cathodes.

abstract = {Machine-learning potentials (MLPs) for atomistic simulations are a promising alternative to conventional classical potentials. Current approaches rely on descriptors of the local atomic environment with dimensions that increase quadratically with the number of chemical species. In this article, we demonstrate that such a scaling can be avoided in practice. We show that a mathematically simple and computationally efficient descriptor with constant complexity is sufficient to represent transition-metal oxide compositions and biomolecules containing 11 chemical species with a precision of around 3 meV/atom. This insight removes a perceived bound on the utility of MLPs and paves the way to investigate the physics of previously inaccessible materials with more than ten chemical species.},

abstract = {In the constant race for more efficient Li-ion batteries, extensive research has focused on the design of new, more competitive cathode materials, currently limiting the battery performance. The improvement of cathode materials demands the detailed understanding of the complex structural mechanisms at play during battery operation, that is, when Li + ions are inserted and extracted from the cathode. Moreover, new cathode designs involve more and more disordered/nanosized materials for enhanced Li + cation diffusion and larger specific surfaces. This trend poses new challenges for the structural investigation methods employed, which mostly rely on the periodic and long-range ordered nature of the compounds under study. This is specially the case of the recently discovered nanostructured Li 4 Mn 2 O 5 high capacity cathode material, which shows record reversible capacities superior to the state-of-the-art Li-Mn-O electrodes and displays a strongly disordered rock salt-type structure. This last feature, mainly due to its synthetic route involving high energy milling, prevented from reaching a full understanding of the lithium exchange mechanism of particular interest in this 3D framework compound. Here, we demonstrate that a thorough description of such a disordered structure can be achieved by a combination of near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and pair distribution function analysis of neutron and X-ray total scattering data, which ultimately lead to the elucidation of the Li cation diffusion pathways.

An increase of the Ni content results in an increase of specific discharge capacity and total residual lithium content but the corresponding capacity retention and safety characteristics gradually decreased. The structural stability is related to the thermal and electrochemical stabilities, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry.

Here, first-principle calculations are presented to investigate the electrochemical activity and structural stability of stoichiometric LixMnO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) as a function of Li content. The Li2MnO3 structure is electrochemically activated above 4.5 V on delithiation and charge neutrality in the bulk of the material is mainly maintained by the oxidization of a portion of the oxygen ions from O2− to O1−. While oxygen vacancy formation is found to be thermodynamically favorable for x {\textless} 1, the activation barriers for O2− and O1− migration remain high throughout the Li com­position range, impeding oxygen release from the bulk of the compound. Defect layered structures become thermodynamically favorable at lower Li content (x {\textless} 1), indicating a tendency towards the spinel-like structure transformation. A critical phase transformation path for forming nuclei of spinel-like domains within the matrix of the original layered structure is proposed. Formation of defect layered structures during the first charge is shown to manifest in a depression of the voltage profile on the first discharge, providing one possible explanation for the observed voltage fade of the Li-excess materials.},

Major advances in rechargeable batteries for portable electronics, electric vehicles and large-scale grid storage will depend on the discovery and exploitation of new high performance materials, which requires a greater fundamental understanding of their properties on the atomic and nanoscopic scales. This review describes some of the exciting progress being made in this area through use of computer simulation techniques, focusing primarily on positive electrode (cathode) materials for lithium-ion batteries, but also including a timely overview of the growing area of new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In general, two main types of technique have been employed, namely electronic structure methods based on density functional theory, and atomistic potentials-based methods. A major theme of much computational work has been the significant synergy with experimental studies. The scope of contemporary work is highlighted by studies of a broad range of topical materials encompassing layered, spinel and polyanionic framework compounds such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4 respectively. Fundamental features important to cathode performance are examined, including voltage trends, ion diffusion paths and dimensionalities, intrinsic defect chemistry, and surface properties of nanostructures.},

Increasingly more researchers are focusing on harvesting and converting solar energy, mechanical vibration, waste heat, and wind to electricity. Electrical energy storage technologies play a significant role in the demand for green and sustainable energy. Rechargeable batteries or secondary batteries, such as Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, and Mg-ion batteries, reversibly convert between electrical and chemical energy via redox reactions, thus storing the energy as chemical potential in their electrodes. The energy density of a rechargeable battery is determined collectively by the specific capacity of electrodes and the working voltage of the cell, which is the differential potential between the cathode and the anode. Over the past decades, a significant number of studies have focused on enhancing this specific capacity; however, studies to understand and manipulate the electrochemical potential of the electrode materials are limited. In this review, the material characteristics that determine and influence the electrochemical potentials of electrodes are discussed. In particular, the cathode materials that convert electricity and chemical potential through electrochemical intercalation reactions are investigated. In addition, we summarize the selection criteria for elements or compounds and the effect of the local atomic environment on the discharge potential, including the effects of site energy, defects, crystallinity, and microstructure, using LiMn2O4, V2O5, Mo6S8, LiFePO4, and LiCoO2as model samples for discussion.},

abstract = {Anionic redox in Li-rich and Na-rich transition metal oxides (A-rich-TMOs) has emerged as a new paradigm to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Ever since, numerous electrodes delivering extra anionic capacity beyond the theoretical cationic capacity have been reported. Unfortunately, most often the anionic capacity achieved in charge is partly irreversible in discharge. A unified picture of anionic redox in A-rich-TMOs is designed here to identify the electronic origin of this irreversibility and to propose new directions to improve the cycling performance of the electrodes. The electron localization function is introduced as a holistic tool to unambiguously locate the oxygen lone pairs in the structure and follow their participation in the redox activity of A-rich-TMOs. The charge-transfer gap of transition metal oxides is proposed as the pertinent observable to quantify the amount of extra capacity achievable in charge and its reversibility in discharge, irrespective of the material chemical composition. From this generalized approach, we conclude that the reversibility of the anionic capacity is limited to a critical number of O holes per oxygen, hO ≤ 1/3.},

abstract = {A number of chemical elements that were once laboratory curiosities now figure prominently in new technologies like wind turbines, solar energy collectors, and electric cars. If widely deployed, such inventions have the capacity to transform the way we produce, transmit, store, or conserve energy. To meet our energy needs and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, novel energy systems must be scaled from laboratory, to demonstration, to widespread deployment. Energy-related systems are typically materials intensive. As new technologies are widely deployed, significant quantities of the elements required to manufacture them will be needed. However, many of these unfamiliar elements are not presently mined, refined, or traded in large quantities, and, as a result, their availability might be constrained by many complex factors. A shortage of these “energy-critical elements” (ECEs) could significantly inhibit the adoption of otherwise game-changing energy technologies. This, in turn, would limit the competitiveness of U.S. industries and the domestic scientific enterprise and, eventually, diminish the quality of life in the United States. ECEs include rare earths, which received much media attention in recent months, but potentially include more than a dozen other chemical elements. The ECEs share common issues and should be considered together in developing policies to promote smooth and rapid deployment of desirable technologies. Several factors can contribute to limiting the domestic availability of an ECE. The element might simply not be abundant in Earth's crust or might not be concentrated by geological processes. An element might only occur in a few economic deposits worldwide, or production might be dominated by and, therefore, subject to manipulation by one or more countries. The United States already relies on other countries for more than 90{\%} of most of the ECEs we identify. Many ECEs have, up to this point, been produced in relatively small quantities as by-products of primary metals refining. Joint production complicates attempts to ramp up output by a large factor. Because they are relatively scarce, extraction of ECEs often involves processing large amounts of material, sometimes in ways that do unacceptable environmental damage. Finally, the time required for production and utilization to adapt to fluctuations in price and availability of ECEs is long, making planning and investment difficult. This report surveys these potential constraints on the availability of ECEs and then identifies five specific areas of potential action by the United States to insure their availability: 1) federal agency coordination; 2) information collection, analysis, and dissemination; 3) research, development, and workforce enhancement; 4) efficient use of materials; and, 5) market interventions. Throughout this report, narratives on particular ECEs are provided to clarify these five action areas.},

For this reason, computations have become a cornerstone of battery-related research by providing insight into fundamental processes that are not otherwise accessible, such as ionic diffusion mechanisms and electronic structure effects, as well as a quantitative comparison with experimental results. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art ab initio approaches for the modelling of battery materials. We consider techniques for the computation of equilibrium cell voltages, 0-Kelvin and finite-temperature voltage profiles, ionic mobility and thermal and electrolyte stability. The strengths and weaknesses of different electronic structure methods, such as DFT+U and hybrid functionals, are discussed in the context of voltage and phase diagram predictions, and we review the merits of lattice models for the evaluation of finite-temperature thermodynamics and kinetics. With such a complete set of methods at hand, first principles calculations of ordered, crystalline solids, i.e., of most electrode materials and solid electrolytes, have become reliable and quantitative. However, the description of molecular materials and disordered or amorphous phases remains an important challenge.

In the first place, the increasing demand for powering systems of portable electronic devices and zero-emission vehicles stimulates research towards high energy and high voltage systems. In the second place, low cost batteries are required in order to advance towards smart electric grids that integrate discontinuous energy flow from renewable sources, optimizing the performance of clean energy sources. Na-ion batteries can be the key for the second point, because of the huge availability of sodium, its low price and the similarity of both Li and Na insertion chemistries. In spite of the lower energy density and voltage of Na-ion based technologies, they can be focused on applications where the weight and footprint requirement is less drastic, such as electrical grid storage. Much work has to be done in the field of Na-ion in order to catch up with Li-ion technology. Cathodic and anodic materials must be optimized, and new electrolytes will be the key point for Na-ion success.

Since poor ionic conduction in solid electrolytes is a major drawback in solid-state batteries, such studies have been focused on the enhancement of ionic conductivity. The studies have identified some high performance solid electrolytes; however, some disadvantages have remained hidden until their use in batteries.

We present a critical and rigorous analysis of the increasing volume of multivalent battery research, focusing on a wide range of intercalation cathode materials and the mechanisms of multivalent ion insertion and migration within those frameworks. The present analysis covers a wide variety of material chemistries, including chalcogenides, oxides, and polyanions, highlighting merits and challenges of each class of materials as multivalent cathodes.

abstract = {Significant research effort has focused on improving the specific energy of lithium-ion batteries for emerging applications, such as electric vehicles. Recently, a rock salt-type Li 4 Mn 2 O 5 cathode material with a large discharge capacity (∼350 mA{\textperiodcentered}hour g −1) was discovered. However, a full structural model of Li 4 Mn 2 O 5 and its corresponding phase transformations, as well as the atomistic origins of the high capacity, warrants further investigation. We use first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate both the disordered rock salt-type Li 4 Mn 2 O 5 structure and the ordered ground-state structure. The ionic ordering in the ground-state structure is determined via a DFT-based enumeration method. We use both the ordered and disordered structures to interrogate the delithiation process and find that it occurs via a three-step reaction pathway involving the complex interplay of cation and anion redox reactions: (i) an initial metal oxidation , Mn 3+ →Mn 4+ (Li x Mn 2 O 5 , 4 {\textgreater} x {\textgreater} 2); (ii) followed by anion oxidation, O 2− →O 1− (2 {\textgreater} x {\textgreater} 1); and (iii) finally, further metal oxidation, Mn 4+ →Mn 5+ (1 {\textgreater} x {\textgreater} 0). This final step is concomitant with the Mn migration from the original octahedral site to the adjacent tetrahedral site, introducing a kinetic barrier to reversible charge/ discharge cycles. Armed with this knowledge of the charging process, we use high-throughput DFT calculations to study metal mixing in this compound, screening potential new materials for stability and kinetic reversibility. We predict that mixing with M = V and Cr in Li 4 (Mn,M) 2 O 5 will produce new stable compounds with substantially improved electrochemical properties.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Although the Li-excess layered-oxide Li2MnO3 has a high theoretical capacity, structural transformations within the oxide during electrochemical cycling lead to relatively low experimental capacities, hindering its use in practical applications. Here, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction are used to characterize the oxide following electrochemical cycling. Microscopy reveals the coexistence of regions with local monoclinic, spinel, and rock-salt symmetries, indicating localized and inhomogeneous structural evolutions. Crystal structure transformations are observed both at the particle surface and in the bulk. At the surface, these transformed regions resemble spinel Mn3O4 or rock-salt MnO, consistent with oxygen loss. In the bulk, the regions resemble defect spinels, such as the layered-spinel LixMn4/3O4, which suggest a partial phase transformation consistent with oxygen retention. Both microscopy and diffraction data of the cycled sample indicate areas of pristine Li2MnO3; the presence of such areas, in close proximity to LixMn4/3O4 areas, suggests that the layered to spinel structure transformation is partially reversible. Spinel, disordered rock salt, and pristine areas are also observed in Li2MnO3 samples intentionally damaged by electron beam irradiation. This observation indicates that the dynamic processes resulting in phase transformations can be studied for a variety of oxide systems by a judicious selection of irradiation conditions. The localized structural and electronic transformations of Li2MnO3 following electrochemical cycling are presented in detail and at the atomic scale through scanning transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction analysis. Transformations are shown to exist in the bulk and at the surface, resulting in regions with defect spinel-LixMn4/3O4, spinel-Mn3O4, and rock-salt MnO symmetry.},

abstract = {The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) is an established method for finding minimum-energy paths and energy barriers of ion migration in materials, but has been hampered in its general application by its significant computational expense when coupled with density functional theory $\backslash$n(DFT) calculations. Typically, an NEB calculation is initialized from a linear interpolation of successive intermediate structures (also known as images) between known initial and final states. However, the linear interpolation introduces two problems: (1) slow convergence of the calculation, particularly in cases where the final path exhibits notable curvature; (2) divergence of the NEB calculations if any intermediate image comes too close to a non-diffusing species, causing instabilities in the ensuing calculation. In this work, we propose a new scheme to accelerate NEB calculations through an improved path initialization and associated energy estimation workflow. We demonstrate that for cation migration in an ionic framework, initializing the diffusion path as the minimum energy path through a static potential built upon the DFT $\backslash$ncharge density reproduces the true NEB path within a 0.2 {\AA} deviation and yields up to a 25{\%} improvement in typical NEB runtimes. Furthermore, we find that the locally relaxed energy barrier derived from this initialization yields a good approximation of the NEB barrier, with errors within 20 meV of the true NEB value, while reducing computational expense by up to a factor of 5. Finally, and of critical importance for the automation of migration path calculations in high-throughput studies, we find that the new approach significantly enhances the stability of the calculation by avoiding unphysical image initialization. Our algorithm promises to enable efficient calculations of diffusion pathways, resolving a long-standing obstacle to the computational screening of intercalation compounds for Li-ion and multivalent batteries.},

abstract = {The increasing presence of Li-Ion batteries (LIB) in mobile and stationary energy storage applications has triggered a growing interest in the environmental impacts associated with their production. Numerous studies on the potential environmental impacts of LIB production and LIB-based electric mobility are available, but these are very heterogeneous and the results are therefore difficult to compare. Furthermore, the source of inventory data, which is key to the outcome of any study, is often difficult to trace back. This paper provides a review of LCA studies on Li-Ion batteries, with a focus on the battery production process. All available original studies that explicitly assess LIB production are summarized, the sources of inventory data are traced back and the main assumptions are extracted in order to provide a quick overview of the technical key parameters used in each study. These key parameters are then compared with actual battery data from industry and research institutions. Based on the results from the reviewed studies, average values for the environmental impacts of LIB production are calculated and the relevance of different assumptions for the outcomes of the different studies is pointed out. On average, producing 1 Wh of storage capacity is associated with a cumulative energy demand of 328 Wh and causes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 110 gCO2eq. Although the majority of existing studies focus on GHG emissions or energy demand, it can be shown that impacts in other categories such as toxicity might be even more important. Taking into account the importance of key parameters for the environmental performance of Li-Ion batteries, research efforts should not only focus on energy density but also on maximizing cycle life and charge-discharge efficiency.},

abstract = {There is an urgent need for low-cost, resource-friendly, high-energy-density cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries to satisfy the rapidly increasing need for electrical energy storage. To replace the nickel and cobalt, which are limited resources and are associated with safety problems, in current lithium-ion batteries, high-capacity cathodes based on manganese would be particularly desirable owing to the low cost and high abundance of the metal, and the intrinsic stability of the Mn 4+ oxidation state. Here we present a strategy of combining high-valent cations and the partial substitution of fluorine for oxygen in a disordered-rocksalt structure to incorporate the reversible Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ double redox couple into lithium-excess cathode materials. The lithium-rich cathodes thus produced have high capacity and energy density. The use of the Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ redox reduces oxygen redox activity, thereby stabilizing the materials, and opens up new opportunities for the design of high-performance manganese-rich cathodes for advanced lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion-based energy storage is becoming a pervasive technology in today's society. Introduced in the early 1990s for use in portable electronics, it has now migrated to applications such as transportation and grid, for which energy storage needs will soon dwarf the use in electronics 1,2 . Indeed, today, with electric vehicles making up about 1{\%} of all car sales, almost half of all Li-ion batteries produced are already directed towards transportation. These new applications increase the demand for safe high-energy storage at low cost and without relying on constrained natural resources 1,2 . In this context, it is remarkable that almost all Li-ion cathode materials rely on only two transition metals, Ni and Co, which are the electroactive elements in the layered-rocksalt cathode materials in the Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O 2 chemical space (NMCs) 3 . On one end of this compositional spectrum, LiCoO 2 dominates the electronics sector, whereas Ni-rich materials are of interest for the auto-motive sector 2 . Although Mn has been used in a spinel cathode 4 , and Fe in the LiFePO 4 olivine 5 , these compounds suffer from low energy density. Given the limits of energy density that can be achieved with the layered NMCs and the potential resource constraints on cobalt 2 , it is of interest to develop high-capacity cathode materials based on other redox metals. In particular, transition metals that can exchange two electrons are of interest for their ability to create high capacity, similar to the Ni 2+ /Ni 4+ couple in NMC cathodes. Low cost and low toxicity make the Mn 2+ /Mn 4+ couple particularly desirable 6 for designing high-performance Li-ion batteries that are also inexpensive and eco-friendly. Manganese is currently used in cathode materials, but mostly in the inert Mn 4+ state, as in NMC cathodes, or for its Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ couple, as in LiMn 2 O 4 spinel 1,3,4,7 . More recently, Mn 3+ has been used in disordered-rocksalt-type cathodes, such as Li 1.3 Mn 0.4 Nb 0.3 O 2 , in which the low capacity from Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ needs to be overcome by a large amount of oxygen redox 8 , which can trigger O loss, resulting in substantial voltage and capacity fade 7,9,10 . In Li 4 Mn 2 O 5 , a high ini-tial capacity ({\textgreater}300 mAh g −1) is achieved by oxidizing Mn 3+ past the standard Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ redox couple, but this causes substantial voltage and capacity fade in subsequent cycles 11 . In our approach, we start instead from Mn 2+ in the discharged state so that a high theoretical capacity can be obtained by oxidizing to Mn 4+ without relying on O redox. Cycling between two stable valence states of Mn, and limiting the O redox, is expected to improve the reversibility of the charge/discharge process. Reduction to Mn 2+ has been observed 12 by lithiation of amor-phous Li 1.5 Na 0.5 MnO 2.85 I 0.12 , but as this cathode material is synthesized in the charged state it does not enable Li to be brought into the Li-ion cell.

Additionally, modeling the thermal properties of materials requires knowledge of the possible ways of displacing the atoms. One solution to finding all symmetrically unique configurations and displacements is to generate the complete list of possible configurations and remove those that are symmetrically equivalent. This approach, however, suffers from a combinatorial explosion when the supercell size is large, when there are more than two atom types, or when there are many displaced atoms. This problem persists even when there are only a relatively small number of unique arrangements that survive the elimination process. Here, we extend an existing algorithm to include the extra configurational degrees of freedom from the inclusion of displacement directions. The algorithm uses group theory and a tree-like data structure to eliminate large classes of configurations, avoiding the typical combinatoric explosion. With this approach we can now enumerate previously inaccessible cases, including atomic displacements.},

abstract = {Electrode materials based on Li-rich layered oxides are of growing interest for high-energy Li-ion battery applications because of their staggering capacities associated with the emergence of a novel, reversible anionic process. However, the fundamental science at work behind this new process needs to be well understood for further optimization. Here we report on the redox mechanisms in high-capacity Li-rich materials Li 2 Ru 1−x M x O 3 and Li 2 Ir 1−x M x O 3 , by combining X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) core peaks and valence intensity analyses. We fully confirm that these materials electrochemically react with Li via cumulative reversible cationic/anionic redox processes, but more importantly we reveal that, depending on the nature of the metal (Ru or Ir), there is a delicate balance between metal and oxygen contributions. For instance, we show a greater implication of oxide ions for Ir-based electrodes, consistent with the higher covalent character of Ir−O bonds compared to Ru−O bonds. We equally provide evidence that the oxygen redox process is responsible for the high capacity displayed by the Li-rich NMC Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn 0.54 O 2 electrodes that are serious contenders for the next generation of Li-ion batteries. These combined results highlight the benefit of collecting both XPS core and valence spectra for a better understanding of anionic redox mechanisms in Li-rich layered oxides. ■ INTRODUCTION Layered lithium transition metal oxides LiMO 2 (where M is composed of transition metals) with low molecular weight, high capacity, and reversibility are one of the best suitable electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. The first commercial Li-ion battery was assembled using LiCoO 2 (∼140 mAh/g) as positive electrode material and graphite as negative. Since then, major advances in enhancing the capacity of layered transition metal oxides have been achieved via chemical substitution. First, the partial replacement of Co 3+ with Ni 2+ and Mn 4+ has led to the Li(Ni 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3)O 2 layered oxides, coined as NMC, which display capacities as high as 200 mAh/g. More recently, further explorations of cationic substitutions in the layered oxide systems have led to materials made of Ni, Co, and Mn with some Li in the transition metal layers, in addition to the Li present in the van der Waals gap, termed as " Li-rich NMC " and showing capacities exceeding 250 mAh/g or greater. 1,2 Such Li-rich NMC electrodes are regarded as serious contenders for next-generation Li-ion batteries. The redox chemistry asso-ciated with the lithium insertion/deinsertion process of these Li-rich phases has been analyzed by our group recently using complementary techniques like X-ray photoemission spectros-copy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) on a model compound Li 2 Ru (1−x) Sn x O 3 . 3 The results in association with structural analysis and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations have revealed the existence of cumulative cationic and anionic reversible redox processes (Ru 4+ /Ru 5+ and O},

abstract = {Materials exhibiting a substitutional disorder such as multicomponent alloys and mixed metal oxides/oxyfluorides are of great importance in many scientific and technological sectors. Disordered materials constitute an overwhelmingly large configurational space, which makes it practically impossible to be explored manually using first-principles calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) due to the high computational costs. Consequently, the use of methods such as cluster expansion (CE) is vital in enhancing our understanding of the disordered materials. CE dramatically reduces the computational cost by mapping the first-principles calculation results on to a Hamiltonian which is much faster to evaluate. In this work, we present our implementation of the CE method, which is integrated as a part of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) open-source package. The versatile and user-friendly code automates the complex set up and construction procedure of CE while giving the users the flexibility to tweak the settings and to import their own structures and previous calculation results. Recent advancements such as regularization techniques from machine learning are implemented in the developed code. The code allows the users to construct CE on any bulk lattice structure, which makes it useful for a wide range of applications involving complex materials. We demonstrate the capabilities of our implementation by analyzing the two example materials with varying complexities: a binary metal alloy and a disordered lithium chromium oxyfluoride.},

abstract = {Since their commercialization Li-ion batteries have relied on the use of layered oxides (LiMO2) as positive electrodes. Over the years, via skilful chemical substitution their performances have drastically improved in terms of safety and capacity, which has nearly doubled (280 mAh/g) with the recent arrival of Li-rich NMC, i.e. layered LiCoO2 in which Co has been simultaneously replaced by Mn, Ni and Li. This review will aim to describe the chemical rationale which has led to this material evolution prior to focus on Li-rich NMC phases which are sources of excitement but challenges as well. The benefits of going back to fundamentals to rationalize and understand the new science at work with these Li-rich NMC phases will be stressed and illustrated by the discovery of a new reversible anionic redox process. Issues regarding voltage fade and limited rate capability which are plaguing their present utilization in commercial Li-ion cells will be addressed as well and solutions proposed. Owing to such advances, layered oxides which are over performing spinel or polyanionic-based compounds have a bright future.},

abstract = {A promising approach to improving the performance of iron-phosphate FePO4 cathode materials for Li-ion batteries is to partly or fully substitute Fe with other metals. Here, we use high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate binary mixtures of metal atoms M and M' in (Li)MyM'1-yPO4 olivine phosphates. We determine the formation energy for various stoichiometries of different binary combinations of metals for the cases of full lithiation and delithiation. Systematic screening of all combinations of Fe and Mn with elements of the 3d transition-metal (TM) series allows us to identify trends with average band filling and atomic size. We also included compounds that verify the observed relations or that were discussed as cathode materials, particularly Ni-Co, V-Cu and V-Ni, as well as combinations with 4d TMs (Fe-Zr, Fe-Mo, Fe-Ag) and with Mg (Fe-Mg and Ni-Mg). Based on our DFT calculations for each compound, we estimate the volume change during intercalation, the intercalation voltage, the energy density and the thermal stability with respect to reaction with oxygen. Our calculations indicate that the energy density of the binary TM phosphates increases with average band filling while the thermal stability of the compounds decreases.},

abstract = {The status of ambient temperature sodium ion batteries is reviewed in light of recent developments in anode, electrolyte and cathode materials. These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identifi ed, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI fi lms. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg − 1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g − 1 and a 500 mAh g − 1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.},

In a half-cell configuration, a nanolayer coating of AlF3on the Li1.1(Ni0.15Co0.1Mn0.55) O1.95stabilizes the capacity on cycling. However, in cell tests with metallic lithium anodes, the initial coulombic efficiency decreased slightly at both 25 and 55°C for AlF3-coated Li1.1(Ni0.15Co0.1Mn0.55) O1.95in comparison to the pristine material. For cells constructed with graphite instead of lithium anodes, the capacity stability improved with cycling for the coated cathode materials. Transition-metal dissolution was more pronounced for the AlF3-coated sample when stored at 55°C in electrolytes. For both the pristine and AlF3-coated samples, there was no extra capacity loss due to the elevated temperature. Around 10{\%} capacity gain of the cathode materials at elevated temperature is assumed to be due to improved thermodynamic activation. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Electrochemical Society.},

abstract = {Ni-rich layered oxides and Li-rich layered oxides are topics of much research interest as cathodes for Li-ion batteries due to their low cost and higher discharge capacities compared to those of LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4. However, Ni-rich layered oxides have several pitfalls, including difficulty in synthesizing a well-ordered material with all Ni3+ ions, poor cyclability, moisture sensitivity, a thermal runaway reaction, and formation of a harmful surface layer caused by side reactions with the electrolyte. Recent efforts towards Ni-rich layered oxides have centered on optimizing the composition and processing conditions to obtain controlled bulk and surface compositions to overcome the capacity fade. Li-rich layered oxides also have negative aspects, including oxygen loss from the lattice during first charge, a large first cycle irreversible capacity loss, poor rate capability, side reactions with the electrolyte, low tap density, and voltage decay during extended cycling. Recent work on Li-rich layered oxides has focused on understanding the surface and bulk structures and eliminating the undesirable properties. Followed by a brief introduction, an account of recent developments on the understanding and performance gains of Ni-rich and Li-rich layered oxide cathodes is provided, along with future research directions.},

All rights reserved.The search for new materials that could improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries is one of today's most challenging issues. Many families of transition metal oxides as well as transition metal polyanionic frameworks have been proposed during the past twenty years. Among them, manganese oxides, such as the LiMn2O4 spinel or the overlithiated oxide Li[Li1/3Mn2/3 ]O2, have been intensively studied owing to the low toxicity of manganese-based materials and the high redox potential of the Mn3+/Mn4+ couple. In this work, we report on a new electrochemically active compound with the 'Li4Mn2O5' composition, prepared by direct mechanochemical synthesis at room temperature. This rock-salt-type nanostructured material shows a discharge capacity of 355 mAh g-1, which is the highest yet reported among the known lithium manganese oxide electrode materials. According to the magnetic measurements, this exceptional capacity results from the electrochemical activity of the Mn3+/Mn4+ and O2-/O- redox couples, and, importantly, of the Mn4+/Mn5+ couple also.},

Here we present atomistic simulations of the surfaces of olivine-structured NaFePO4 as a sodium-ion battery cathode, and discuss differences in its morphology compared to the lithium analogue LiFePO4. The calculated equilibrium morphology is mostly isometric in appearance, with (010), (201) and (011) faces dominant. Exposure of the (010) surface is vital because it is normal to the one-dimensional ion-conduction pathway. Platelet and cube-like shapes observed by previous microscopy studies are reproduced by adjusting surface energies. The results indicate that a variety of (nano)particle morphologies can be achieved by tuning surface stabilities, which depend on synthesis methods and solvent conditions, and will be important in optimising electrochemical performance.},

abstract = {LiFePO4, as the most famous member of the family of olivine-type lithium transition metal phosphates, is one of the promising candidates for the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries. However, its battery performance is limited by its low electrical conductivity and slow Li solid-state diffusion. Various methods have been attempted to improve the battery performance of lithium iron phosphate. Among them, compositing the LiFePO4with carbon nanomaterials seems to be the most promising, as it is facile and efficient. Carbon nanomaterials usually serve as a conductive agent to improve the electrical conductivity while increasing the material porosity in which the solid-state diffusion distances are significantly shortened. Owing to the popularity of various carbonaceous nanomaterials, there is no straightforward line of research for comparing the LiFePO4/C nanocomposites. This review aims to provide a general perspective based on the research achievements reported in the literature. While surveying the research findings reported in the literature, controversial issues are also discussed. The possible contribution of pseudocapacitance as a result of functionalized carbon or LiFePO4lattice defects is described, since from a practical perspective, a LiFePO4/C electrode can be considered as a supercapacitor at high C rates (with a specific capacitance as large as 200 F g−1). The Li diffusion in LiFePO4has not been well understood yet; while the Li diffusion within the LiFePO4lattice seems to be quite fast, the peculiar interfacial electrochemistry of LiFePO4slows down the diffusion within the entire electrode by a few orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {In this work, we studied the cycling performance of initially inactive Li 2MnO 3 electrodes prepared from micron-sized particles, at 30 °C and 60 °C and possible structural transitions that this material can undergo due to de-lithiation. It was found that being activated at elevated temperatures, Li 2MnO 3 electrodes demonstrate a steady-state cycling behavior and reasonable capacity retention after aging at 60 °C. The main gases evolved during polarization of the Li 2MnO 3 electrodes are O 2 evolved from the structure and CO 2 and CO that can be formed due the reaction of oxygen with carbon black. It was found that a transformation of the Li 2MnO 3 layered structure into a spinel-like phase occurred during the initial charging of the Li 2MnO 3 electrodes, which were characterized as possessing domains of both layered and spinel-like structures. The results of the structural studies of these electrodes obtained by the X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were found to be in agreement with their Raman spectroscopic responses. We suggest that the mechanism of the charge compensation during the extraction of lithium at 60 °C involves both oxygen removal from the Li 2MnO 3 structure and the exchange between Li + and protons formed during the anodic oxidation of ethylene carbonate or dimethyl carbonate solvents in LiPF 6 solutions at high potentials ({\textgreater}4.5 V). It is assumed that the proton-containing structure Li 2-xH x-yMnO 3-0.5y is retained in a discharged state of the electrode and may decompose above 500 °C with the formation of Li 2O and manganese oxides accompanied by the release of water and CO 2. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Its practical capacity is close to the theoretical limit (170 mAh g−1) but the voltage is only 3.5 V vs. Li+/Li. The quest for higher energy density has led to consider the replacement of Fe by Co or Ni, which would raise the working potential to 4.8 and 5.1 V, respectively. The aim of the present work is to review the recent progress and to determine the possibility that these materials will be viable as commercial cathode materials for future Li batteries.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.The search for new materials that could improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries is one of today's most challenging issues. Many families of transition metal oxides as well as transition metal polyanionic frameworks have been proposed during the past twenty years. Among them, manganese oxides, such as the LiMn2O4 spinel or the overlithiated oxide Li[Li1/3Mn2/3 ]O2, have been intensively studied owing to the low toxicity of manganese-based materials and the high redox potential of the Mn3+/Mn4+ couple. In this work, we report on a new electrochemically active compound with the 'Li4Mn2O5' composition, prepared by direct mechanochemical synthesis at room temperature. This rock-salt-type nanostructured material shows a discharge capacity of 355 mAh g-1, which is the highest yet reported among the known lithium manganese oxide electrode materials. According to the magnetic measurements, this exceptional capacity results from the electrochemical activity of the Mn3+/Mn4+ and O2-/O- redox couples, and, importantly, of the Mn4+/Mn5+ couple also.},

abstract = {Cumulative anionic/cationic bulk redox processes lead to the outstanding specific energy (1000 Wh kg −1) of Li-rich Mn-based layered oxides as lithium-ion battery cathodes. Previous attempts to quantify redox processes in these materials were either limited to initial cycles or relied solely on the transition metals. It thus remains unclear to what extent does oxygen redox persist over cycling. This study provides an answer via synchrotron-based bulk-sensitive hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) by directly following the changes in the electronic state of lattice oxygen. We find that oxygen redox contribution stabilizes after initial cycles in Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Mn 0.54 Co 0.13 O 2 (Li-rich NMC), and even after 70 cycles, it accounts for more than one-third of the overall capacity. Consequently, we observe a gradual but limited growth of Mn 3+/4+ redox, instead of a complete activation. Partial degradation of the Ni 2+/3+/4+ redox is also detected. This fundamental study generates optimism for the concept of anionic redox in long-cycling batteries and also highlights the capability of HAXPES for understanding bulk versus surface effects in energy materials. A nionic redox in transition-metal oxides has lately emerged as a promising concept of solid-state electrochemistry to design materials for energy storage and conversion. 1 It has unlocked the possibility to reversibly and repeatedly perform (de)intercalation reactions via the redox activity of bulk oxide anions, in addition to the conventionally utilized transition-metal redox. The energy storage limit of such oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries has thus been increased, and the materials design space has also been widened. 2 Subsequent to our group's fundamental investigations on "model" materials based on 4d and 5d transition-metal layered oxides, 3 several studies 4−11 have now proven that lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxides, such as Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Mn 0.54 Co 0.13 O 2 (Li-rich NMC) that is derived from Li 2 MnO 3 , also exhibit combined anionic/cationic redox activity to deliver reversible capacities above 270 mAh g −1 and approach 1000 Wh kg −1 of specific energy at the material level. 12−18 These attributes, along with the limited use of scarce cobalt and nickel, make the Li-rich NMC family a strong competitor of today's Ni-based layered oxides 19 (NMCs) that are derived from LiNiO 2. NMCs are also undergoing rapid innovation owing to their promise of up to 800 Wh kg −1 at the material level. 2,12 Therefore, for Li-rich cathodes to stay relevant in this duel, 2 several obstacles need to be eliminated, namely, insufficient electrode density, 12 large voltage hyste-resis, 8,20 sluggish kinetics, 8,21 and voltage decay upon aging. 22 In this study, we focus on the aging behavior of Li-rich NMC, particularly on how the anionic/cationic redox activities evolve over cycling, which is essential for the fundamental understanding of degradation mechanisms. Most reports on anionic redox in these materials were limited to the investigation of charge-compensation in the first couple of cycles. 4−11 Although a recent study reported redox evolutions over long cycling, it relied on transition metals' spectra because the direct quantification of oxygen spectra was not possible. 23 Among the spectroscopic techniques that have been adopted by the battery community specifically for the direct character},

An aqueous electrolyte has a window of 1.2 eV, which prevents achieving the high energy density desired for many applications. A non-aqueous electrolyte with a window of 5 eV requires Li+rather than H+as the working ion. Early experiments with LixTiS2cathodes showed competitive capacity and rate capability, but problems with a lithium anode made the voltage of a safe cell based on a sulfide cathode too low to be competitive with a nickel/metal-hydride battery. Transition-metal oxides can give voltages of 4.5 V versus Li+/Li0. However, the challenge with oxides has been to obtain a competitive capacity and rate capability while retaining a high voltage with low-cost, environmentally friendly cathode materials.

abstract = {Lithium (Li)-ion batteries (LIB) have governed the current worldwide rechargeable battery market due to their outstanding energy and power capability. In particular, the LIB's role in enabling electric vehicles (EVs) has been highlighted to replace the current oil-driven vehicles in order to reduce the usage of oil resources and generation of CO2 gases. Unlike Li, sodium is one of the more abundant elements on Earth and exhibits similar chemical properties to Li, indicating that Na chemistry could be applied to a similar battery system. In the 1970s-80s, both Na-ion and Li-ion electrodes were investigated, but the higher energy density of Li-ion cells made them more applicable to small, portable electronic devices, and research efforts for rechargeable batteries have been mainly concentrated on LIB since then. Recently, research interest in Na-ion batteries (NIB) has been resurrected, driven by new applications with requirements different from those in portable electronics, and to address the concern on Li abundance. In this article, both negative and positive electrode materials in NIB are briefly reviewed. While the voltage is generally lower and the volume change upon Na removal or insertion is larger for Na-intercalation electrodes, compared to their Li equivalents, the power capability can vary depending on the crystal structures. It is concluded that cost-effective NIB can partially replace LIB, but requires further investigation and improvement.},

abstract = {The simple classical theories of the dielectric constants and compressibility of ionic crystals lead to two relations among the experimental quantities from which arbitrary parameters have been eliminated, the Szigeti relations. Neither is satisfied by the data, indicating the inadequacy of these simple theories. The short-range repulsive interaction between ions with closed shell electron configurations is investigated, and an approximate interpretation of the Born-Mayer potential in terms of overlap integrals is developed. These results are applied to the interaction of model ions consisting of rigid charged shells bound to cores by harmonic restoring forces. Using this model, polarization mechanisms neglected in the simple dielectric constant theory, the "short range interaction polarization," and the "exchange charge polarization" are described. Both arise from charge redistributions occurring when the ions move with resulting changes in electron overlaps. Applied to a crystal, these ion models permit the derivation of generalizations of the Szigeti, Clausius-Mossotti, and Lorenz-Lorentz relations. The e* / e of the second Szigeti relation can then be calculated and comparison with the e* / e values derived from experimental data imply that the above polarization mechanisms must be at least in part responsible for the deviation of this parameter from unity. The failure of the first Szigeti relation is discussed and attributed to the inadequacy of the treatment of compressibility. The additivity feature of the simple theory and its absence in the refined theory are discussed in relation to the so-called vacuum and crystal ion polarizabilities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. Mixed-anion oxyfluorides (i.e., FeO x F 2-x ) are an appealing alternative to pure fluorides as high-capacity cathodes in lithium batteries, with enhanced cyclability via oxygen substitution. However, it is still unclear how the mixed anions impact the local phase transformation and structural stability of oxyfluorides during cycling due to the complexity of electrochemical reactions, involving both lithium intercalation and conversion. Herein, we investigated the local chemical and structural ordering in FeO 0.7 F 1.3  at length scales spanning from single particles to the bulk electrode, via a combination of electron spectrum-imaging, magnetization, electrochemistry, and synchrotron X-ray measurements. The FeO 0.7 F 1.3  nanoparticles retain a FeF 2 -like rutile structure but chemically heterogeneous, with an F-rich core covered by thin O-rich shell. Upon lithiation the O-rich rutile phase is transformed into Li-Fe-O(-F) rocksalt that has high lattice coherency with converted metallic Fe, a feature that may facilitate the local electronic and ionic transport. The O-rich rocksalt is highly stable over lithiation/delithiation and thus advantageous to maintain the integrity of the particle, and due to its predominant distribution on the surface, it is expected to prevent the catalytic interaction of Fe with electrolyte. Our findings of the structural origin of cycling stability in oxyfluorides may provide insights into developing viable high-energy electrodes for lithium batteries.},

Ever since, numerous electrodes delivering extra anionic capacity beyond the theoretical cationic capacity have been reported. Unfortunately, most often the anionic capacity achieved in charge is partly irreversible in discharge. A unified picture of anionic redox in A-rich-TMOs is designed here to identify the electronic origin of this irreversibility and to propose new directions to improve the cycling performance of the electrodes. The electron localization function is introduced as a holistic tool to unambiguously locate the oxygen lone pairs in the structure and follow their participation in the redox activity of A-rich-TMOs. The charge-transfer gap of transition metal oxides is proposed as the pertinent observable to quantify the amount of extra capacity achievable in charge and its reversibility in discharge, irrespective of the material chemical composition. From this generalized approach, we conclude that the reversibility of the anionic capacity is limited to a critical number of O holes per oxygen, hO ≤ 1/3.},

abstract = {The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) is an established method for finding minimum-energy paths and energy barriers of ion migration in materials, but has been hampered in its general application by its significant computational expense when coupled with density functional theory $\backslash$n(DFT) calculations. Typically, an NEB calculation is initialized from a linear interpolation of successive intermediate structures (also known as images) between known initial and final states. However, the linear interpolation introduces two problems: (1) slow convergence of the calculation, particularly in cases where the final path exhibits notable curvature; (2) divergence of the NEB calculations if any intermediate image comes too close to a non-diffusing species, causing instabilities in the ensuing calculation. In this work, we propose a new scheme to accelerate NEB calculations through an improved path initialization and associated energy estimation workflow. We demonstrate that for cation migration in an ionic framework, initializing the diffusion path as the minimum energy path through a static potential built upon the DFT $\backslash$ncharge density reproduces the true NEB path within a 0.2 {\AA} deviation and yields up to a 25{\%} improvement in typical NEB runtimes. Furthermore, we find that the locally relaxed energy barrier derived from this initialization yields a good approximation of the NEB barrier, with errors within 20 meV of the true NEB value, while reducing computational expense by up to a factor of 5. Finally, and of critical importance for the automation of migration path calculations in high-throughput studies, we find that the new approach significantly enhances the stability of the calculation by avoiding unphysical image initialization. Our algorithm promises to enable efficient calculations of diffusion pathways, resolving a long-standing obstacle to the computational screening of intercalation compounds for Li-ion and multivalent batteries.},

Our simulation model shows good reproduction of the observed olivine-type structure of LiFePO4. The most favorable intrinsic defect is the Li−Fe “anti-site” pair in which a Li ion (on the M1 site) and an Fe ion (on the M2 site) are interchanged. This type of anti-site defect or “intersite exchange” has been observed in olivine silicates. The lowest Li migration energy is found for the pathway along the [010] channel, with a nonlinear, curved trajectory between adjacent Li sites. Trends in dopant substitution energetics of a range of cations with charges varying from +2 to +5 are also examined. Low favorable energies are found only for divalent dopants on the Fe site (such as Mn), which is in accord with experimental work. Our results suggest that, on energetic grounds, LiFePO4 is not tolerant to aliovalent doping (e.g., Al, Ga, Zr, Ti, Nb, Ta) on either Li (M1) or Fe (M2) sites.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. Development of high conductivity solid-state electrolytes for lithium ion batteries has proceeded rapidly in recent years, but incorporating these new materials into high-performing batteries has proven difficult. Interfacial resistance is now the limiting factor in many systems, but the exact mechanisms of this resistance have not been fully explained - in part because experimental evaluation of the interface can be very difficult. In this work, we develop a computational methodology to examine the thermodynamics of formation of resistive interfacial phases. The predicted interfacial phase formation is well correlated with experimental interfacial observations and battery performance. We calculate that thiophosphate electrolytes have especially high reactivity with high voltage cathodes and a narrow electrochemical stability window. We also find that a number of known electrolytes are not inherently stable but react in situ with the electrode to form passivating but ionically conducting barrier layers. As a reference for experimentalists, we tabulate the stability and expected decomposition products for a wide range of elec trolyte, coating, and electrode materials including a number of high-performing combinations that have not yet been attempted experimentally.},

@article{Blomgren2017,
abstract = {This year, the battery industry celebrates the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the lithium ion rechargeable battery by Sony Corporation. The discovery of the system dates back to earlier work by Asahi Kasei in Japan, which used a combination of lower temperature carbons for the negative electrode to prevent solvent degradation and lithium cobalt dioxide modified somewhat from Goodenough's earlier work. The development by Sony was carried out within a few years by bringing together technology in film coating from their magnetic tape division and electrochemical technology from their battery division. The past 25 years has shown rapid growth in the sales and in the benefits of lithium ion in comparison to all the earlier rechargeable battery systems. Recent work on new materials shows that there is a good likelihood that the lithium ion battery will continue to improve in cost, energy, safety and power capability and will be a formidable competitor for some years to come.},

It is an attempt to introduce density-functional theory (DFT) in a language accessible for students entering the field or researchers from other fields. It is not meant to be a scholarly review of DFT, but rather an informal guide to its conceptual basis and some recent developments and advances. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and the Kohn-Sham equations are discussed in some detail. Approximate density functionals, selected aspects of applications of DFT, and a variety of extensions of standard DFT are also discussed, albeit in less detail. Throughout it is attempted to provide a balanced treatment of aspects that are relevant for chemistry and aspects relevant for physics, but with a strong bias towards conceptual foundations. The paper is intended to be read before (or in parallel with) one of the many excellent more technical reviews available in the literature.},

abstract = { Olivine-type phosphates LiFePO 4 and NaFePO 4 are among the most widely studied cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. Here we show that tensile strain applied perpendicularly to the alkali-ion migration channels will improve their intercalation properties.  Olivine-type phosphates LiFePO 4 and NaFePO 4 are among the most widely studied cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. To improve their rate behaviour for future electronic and vehicle applications, it is vital that the Li + and Na + conductivities be enhanced. In this study, atomistic simulation methods (including molecular dynamics) are used to investigate the effect of lattice strain on ion transport and defect formation in olivine-type LiFePO 4 and NaFePO 4 , as these properties are directly related to their intercalation behaviour. The results suggest that lattice strain can have a remarkable effect on the rate performance of cathode materials, with a major increase in the ionic conductivity and decrease in blocking defects at room temperature. Such understanding is important for the future optimization of high-rate cathodes for rechargeable batteries, and is relevant to the growing interest in developing thin film solid-state batteries. },

In this paper we discuss and apply an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to estimate parameters of dynamical models. We show that ABC SMC gives information about the inferability of parameters and model sensitivity to changes in parameters, and tends to perform better than other ABC approaches. The algorithm is applied to several well known biological systems, for which parameters and their credible intervals are inferred. Moreover, we develop ABC SMC as a tool for model selection; given a range of different mathematical descriptions, ABC SMC is able to choose the best model using the standard Bayesian model selection apparatus.},
